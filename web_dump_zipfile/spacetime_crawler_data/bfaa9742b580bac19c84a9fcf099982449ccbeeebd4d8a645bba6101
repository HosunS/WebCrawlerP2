<H3>Announcement 3: 1/10/02</H3>

there is an error in the lab notes, to format a floppy it should be:
<br>
mkfs -t msdos /dev/fd0
<br>

the notes refers to "floppy" instead of "fd0"
<br>
some extra pointers from the TA:
<br>
The mount command works fine: "mount /mnt/floppy"
<br>
You can then type "df" to see the file system it is on, which shows that
the path /mnt/floppy is mounted on /dev/fd0
<br>
When you're done saving your files, be sure to change to a different
directory and then do a "umount /mnt/floppy" before you remove the
diskette.
<br>

<H3>Announcement 2: 1/9/02</H3>

The class size will not be increased. I can only add students to replace the drops. So far there have been very few drops (2 to be exact).
<br>

<H3>Announcement 1: 1/7/02</H3>

Welcome to ICS 156 Announcement page. Please make sure you check this page on a weekly basis and in particular prior to starting your lab as updates may be posted. 
<br>
All information regarding the midterm and the final will be posted on this page too.
