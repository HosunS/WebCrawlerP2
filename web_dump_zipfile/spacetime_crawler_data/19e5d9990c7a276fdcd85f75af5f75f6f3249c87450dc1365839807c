Phyllis,

Thank you for your inquiry and sorry for the delay in
responding. I would like to try and work with you on this.
I do not have this Sarah LANGSAM (now Kendal) in my tree
yet. Researching Yad Vashem in Israel I think I may have
found a nephew to Yakov Rosen: Shlomo Salomon Rosen, a
nephew to Yakov Rosen (married to a Kendal), submitted
pages of testimony to Yad Vashem in 2000. His address is in
Ein Kerem in Israel and he is a Holocaust survivor. His
phone number in 2000 was 02/6411948. He states that Yaakov
perished in 1940 in Strzyzow, Poland and had 4 children.

Please also contact Suzan Wynne, another LANGSAM descendent
at srwynne@erols.com. She may have access to certian
records from Poland regarding LANGSAM. I have copied her on
my response.

Please let me know if there is any more information
available. Also, can you provide an exact connection from
you to Sarah LANGSAM?

Lastly, you may want to review the LANGSAM family tree
available at my website: www.langsam.com
