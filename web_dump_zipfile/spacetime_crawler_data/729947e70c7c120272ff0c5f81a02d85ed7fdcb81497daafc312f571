&lt;&gt; Beardwood, et al. (1959) published a report in which they showed that
&lt;&gt; the expected minimum distance of a Traveling Salesman Problem solution
&lt;&gt; is approximately 0.749 sqrt(N), where N points are randomly distributed
&lt;&gt; in the unit square.
&lt;
&lt;They arrived at this via Monte Carlo simulation, and I don't think
&lt;that it's correct to even two decimal places.  I've seen two other
&lt;numbers for this constant quoted and all three disagree.  Does anyone
&lt;know the *actual* value for this constant to 3 or more decimal places?
&lt;
&lt;&gt; I would like to know whether a similar expected MAXIMUM distance can be
&lt;&gt; computed?  Also, is the distribution of TSP solutions for an N city problem
&lt;&gt; known?
&lt;
&lt;Is this where the salesman is paid by the hour?  I don't know the
&lt;answer, but my guess would be that it's approximately c*N^2, for some
&lt;constant c.

   As long as we are guessing, I'll predict that the correct value of the 
constant .749... can be found in the Calcutta Mathematical Journal (c 1938) 
in a paper titled something like--"On the average height of jute crop in the 
month of September." I think Beardwood et al were aware of this paper (in fact 
it may even be a reference in their paper). It's been a long time since I read
it. Or maybe the reference can be found in Karp's paper on the Euclidean 
Traveling Salesman. I seem to remember that the C * sqrt (N) expected minimum
distance follows from results in the CMJ.
