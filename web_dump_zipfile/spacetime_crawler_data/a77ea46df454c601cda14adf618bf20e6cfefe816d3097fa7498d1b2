<a href="lectures/re.txt">Regular Expressions</a><br>
In the context of studying EBNF, we will discuss using regular expressions
  (one application is searching in the Eclipse text editor).
Each regular expression is like the right hand side of an EBNF rule,
  although it uses a different notation and includes more options.
For Python, see the following links which
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">Document (6.2)</a>
  and
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html">Discuss</a> them.
Googling <b>regular expressions</b> bring up 14 million documents.
