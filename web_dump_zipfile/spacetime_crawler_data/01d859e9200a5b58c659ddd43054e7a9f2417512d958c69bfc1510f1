          <li> <b> Skyway: Connecting managed heaps</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Abstract:</u> Managed languages such as Java and
              Scala while are prevalently used in the development of
              large-scale distributed systems, incurr non-trivial
              overheads. For instance, when performing data transfer
              across machines, the source system needs to serialize
              objects while the destination must perform
              deserialization. This process is both
              performance-inefficient and labor-intensive. Skyway is a
              JVM-based technique that can directly connect managed
              heaps of different JVM processes. Under Skyway, objects
              in the source heap can be directly written into a remote
              heap. Skyway provides performance benefit to any
              JVM-based system by completely eliminating the need (1)
              of invoking serialization/deserialization functions,
              thus saving CPU time, and (2) of requiring developers 
              to hand-write serialization functions.

          <li> <b> BigSAT: SAT solving at scale</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Abstract:</u> The mainstream SAT solvers are all
              based on the DPLL (David-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland)
              algorithm that is memory efficient but difficult to
              parallelize. To build a truly scalable SAT solver, we
              shift our focus to a long overlooked algorithm, the DP
              (David-Putnam) procedure, that performs explicit
              resolutions over clauses. DP consumes more memory but
              exhibits data parallelism, lending itself to systems
              optimizations that achieve efficiency and scalability by
              utilizing large computing resources.
              <li> This work is under development. We will report the result soon.

	<li> <b>Yak: a high-performance Big-Data-friendly garbage collector</b> 
	  <ul>
	    <li><u>Abstract:</u> Big Data applications often are
	    written in managed languages and have a clear logical
	    distinction between a control path and a data path. These
	    two paths follow different heap usage
	    patterns. State-of-the-art garbage collectors while are
	    effective in the control path, are fundamentally limited
	    in the data path, where most objects are created. This
	    project aims to provide an automated and systematic
	    JVM-based solution while requiring minimal user
	    effort. Our results shows that we can effectively reduce
	    the GC time and improve end-to-end performance
	    considerably.

	<li> <b>Interruptible Tasks: Treating memory pressure as interrupts</b>
	  <ul> 
	    <li><u>Abstract:</u> Real-world data-parallel tasks
	    developed in managed languages such as Java and C#
	    commonly suffer from great memory pressure. This leads to
	    excessive GC effort and out-of-memory errors,
	    significantly hurting system performance and
	    scalability. Interruptible task is a new type of
	    data-parallel task that can be interrupted upon memory
	    pressure - with part or all of their used memory
	    reclaimed - and resumed when the pressure goes
	    away. Experiments on two state-of-the-art platforms Hadoop
	    and Hyracks show the effectiveness of the technique. All
	    13 reproduced real-world out-of-memory problems reported
	    on Hadoop are solved using our system. A second set of
	    experiments with 5 already well-tuned programs in Hyracks
	    on datasets of different sizes shows that the our versions
	    are 1.5-3x faster and scale to 3-24x larger datasets.
	    <li> The paper was accepted in SOSP'15. <a class="1" href="papers/sosp15.pdf">[PDF]</a> <a class="1" href="papers/sosp15_1c.pdf">[1-column PDF]</a>.

	  </ul>
	  <br>
	  
	<li> <b>Facade: a compiler and runtime support for (almost) object-bounded Big Data applications</b> 
	  <ul> 
	    <li> <u>Abstract:</u> Popular Big Data platforms use
	    managed object-oriented programming language such as Java
	    due to its quick development cycle and rich community
	    resources. However, when object-orientation meets Big
	    Data, the cost of the managed runtime system is
	    significantly magnified and becomes a
	    scalability-prohibiting bottleneck. This project aims to
	    remove this bottleneck in Big Data applications by
	    introducing the novel compiler framework called
	    Facade. Facade can automatically generate highly efficient
	    data manipulation code by transforming the data path of an
	    existing Big Data application. The key to efficiency is
	    that in the generated code, the number of heap objects
	    created for data types in each thread is statically
	    bounded regardless of how much data an application has to
	    process. Using Facade, one can obtain significantly
	    reduced memory management costs and improved scalability.

	<li><b>Cachetor: Detecting cacheable data to remove bloat</b>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <u>Abstract:</u> Modern object-oriented software
	    commonly suffers from runtime bloat that significantly
	    affects its performance and scalability. One pattern of
	    bloat is the work repeatedly done to compute the same data
	    values. Cachetor is a novel runtime profiling tool that is
	    effective in exposing caching opportunities and
	    substantial performance gains can be achieved by modifying
	    the program to cache the reported data.
