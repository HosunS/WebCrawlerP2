PS Copy of news letter:
Bielsko-Bia3a 7.09.1997
Dear Sirs!
     
We would like to inform you that a few months ago Jewish cemetery in Oï¿½wiï¿½cim 
(Auschwitz) was taken over by The Jewish Community in Bielsko-Bia3a. The Jewish 
Community in Bielsko-Bia3a decided to interest itself in this object and take 
care of its appearance. They also decided to carry out a detailed inventory list
of tombstones and, there fore, they contacted
The Provincial Authorities in Bielsko-Bia3a and The State Service for the 
Preservation of the Monuments in Bielsko-Bia3a. After the decision of the 
beginning of inventory was made,
The Provincial Authorities in Bielsko-Bia3a assigned for this purpose over 2500 
US$, while
The State Service for the Preservation of the Monuments in agreement with The 
Jewish Community, assigned a person who would carry out the inventory.
This person is Jacek Proszyk ? student of Warsaw University who knows Hebrew 
language and has already made the inventory of about 4000 tombstones on the 
other five Jewish cemeteries. Mr. Proszyk began the works in June 1997 and is 
planning to finish them in November 1997.
The inventory activities are follows: taking picture of the tombstone; writing 
down and translating
a full remained Hebrew inscription; measuring the tombstone; defining the 
material of which the tombstone was made; describing the architectonic 
appearance, symbols and ornamentation; matching and painting a number on the 
tombstone; describing the condition and conservation needs. The inventory will 
be carried out by using standardised index cards of monuments and will be placed
in the archives The State Service for the Preservation of the Monuments with 
negatives and floppy disk containing a full record. In virtue of the inventory 
The Jewish Community in Bielsko-Bia3a will be giving out certifications 
confirming the existence of particular tombstones.
Mr. Proszyk stated that on the cemetery remained over 800 tombstones and the 
oldest one, found until now, dated back to 1757 year.
        Despite of the index cards, there will be printed an alphabetic list of
surnames and names with the date of death and the tombstone's number. It will 
help families who visit the cemetery, to find the tombs of their ancestors 
without any problem.
In spite of a great help and interest of polish authorities, the financial means
are not sufficient to finish the inventory on time. Therefore, if you are 
interested in hereby project,
we would like to ask for a financial support. To cover the present costs which 
were borne during the inventory works, we need an amount of 500 US$. All 
payments com be remitted on account of the Jewish Community:
Bank Polska Kasa Opieki SA, Grupa PeKaO SA 
43-300 Bielsko-Bia3a, Grunwaldzka str. 40a 
No 12401170-508447-2700-401112-001
"For cemetery in Oswiecim"
At the same time, please inform about our project all these persons who can be 
interested in it. Also, we will answer all the questions referring to the 
tombstones of the persons buried on the cemeteries in Oï¿½wiï¿½cim (Auschwitz), 
Bielsko-Bia3a (Bielitz, Biala), _ywiec (Saybusch), Milï¿½wka (Milowka), Skoczï¿½w 
(Skotschau), Cieszyn (Teschen), Ustroï¿½ (Ustron).
     
Best regards
