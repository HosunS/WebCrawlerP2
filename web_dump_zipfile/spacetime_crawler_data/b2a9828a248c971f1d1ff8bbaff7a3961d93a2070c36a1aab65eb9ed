Subject: Langsam Family ?

Mr. Langsam from Montreal suggested that I contact you.
My great-great grandmother was Sora Langsam from Sunik. She married Hersh Grumet who
passed away in 1923. His parents were Avrohom and Chaya Grumet. Incidentally my
maternal grandmother was named after her and I know they were Bluzhover Chassidim. I
was in touch with Suzan Wynnne and looked at the Langsam genealogy book, but couldn't
find their names there.
I have been doing family research for a long time and can't seem to discover Sora Langsam's
ancestors. Would you have any suggestions as to where I should continue my research?
Thank you so much.

Hi,
Can you provide year of birth/passing for Sora? What about siblings and names
of all children?

Thank you very much for responding to my email. According to the records I have,
Sara Langsam passed away before 1911. She was married to Hersh Grumet who was 
born around 1849 in Siemuszowa and passed away in 1923 in Sunik. Her children 
were Moshe Grumet (my great-grandfather who was born in Sunik in 1879 and moved 
to Pittsburgh [in 1910] and passed away in 1959), Mindel (Wedner, lived in 
Pittsburgh), Meyer Binyamin (lived in Pittsburgh), Chaya (lived in Pittsburgh), 
Rivka, Mechel, and maybe three other siblings.

I have no information about any of Sara Langsam's siblings or ancestors.
Thank you very much for taking an interest. Any information you may have would be
greatly appreciated.

Hello,
Thank you for your kind words and for your interest. I am so sorry for the long 
delay in responding.

Have you learned anything new? Can I help connect your family to our Langsam tree?

Thank you so much for your email.

I went onto your website and found it to be truly amazing. I did find one piece of 
helpful information since I can't seem to find any clue of family members before 
Sara Langsam and Hersh Grumet married. In your family tree there is a son of Pesach 
Langsam named Chaim Leib and it is written on the bottom that not much is known 
about the daughters Chava, Ita, Pessel, and Golda except that they married into the 
Popper, Grumet and Bernstein families.

Maybe that is why I have been having such a hard time tracking down my ancestry. There 
doesn't seem to be much information available. I looked through the Langsam book once 
but couldn't find anything; it was very quickly on a Shabbos afternoon. Is there any 
way I can get a copy of the book so I can go through it in more depth?

Thank you so much again -

Thank you for your email. I am resending the information that I previously sent you 
and have added an addendum with bits of information that I found.

According to the records I have, my great-great grandmother Sara Langsam from Sunik 
passed away before 1911. She was married to Hersh Grumet who was born around 1849 in
Siemuszowa and passed away in 1923 in Sunik. Hersh Grumet's parents were Avrahom and
Chaya Grumet. Sara and Hersh Grumet's children were Moshe Grumet (my great-grandfather
who was born in Sunik in 1879 and moved to Pittsburgh [in 1910] and passed away in 1959),
Mindel (Wedner, lived in Pittsburgh), Meyer Binyamin (lived in Pittsburgh), Chaya (lived
in Pittsburgh), Rivka, Mechel, and maybe three other siblings.

I have no information about any of Sara Langsam's siblings or ancestors.

	Incidentally my maternal grandmother was named after Sara Langsam and I know
	they were Bluzhover Chassidim. I was in touch with Suzan Wynnne and looked at
	the Langsam genealogy book, but couldn't find their names there.

Addendum:
Sarah and Hersh Grumet likely had nine children. They may have married in 1879. The 
oldest Mindel was born in 1876 and passed away in Pittsburgh at the age of 96. She 
married Avrohom Wedner who was born in 1873 in Sunik. Rivka was born in 1882, Mayer 
Binyamin was born in 1886 and he married Rivka Mallinger born 1890 in a Sunik village 
"Pielnia" but they married in Pittsburgh. Chaya was born in 1890.

Hersh Grumet had at least two siblings: Shmuel b. 1847 and d. 1923 Sunik, and Roiza b 
about 1849 and there married Yosef Grumet.

Avrahom and Chaya were born before 1827.

My grandmother Sara Grumet came over with her mother Miriam who married Moshe (who left
to America first) around 1921 on the Aquitania to Ellis Island. Miriam (Wertenteil or 
Bertenthal) was born in Przysietnica in the district of Brzozow.

I know this mainly deals with the Grumet family - that is why I am so lost when it 
comes to the Langsam family.

If you can be of any help, I will be so grateful.

Meanwhile, have a Good Shabbos and thank you once again.
