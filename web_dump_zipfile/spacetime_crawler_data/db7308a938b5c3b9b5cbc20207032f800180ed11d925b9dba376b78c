<P>So here are some issues for the future.</P>

<P></P>

<P>One is, are you browsing or authoring? This is actually a tough usability problem. Netscape Navigator Gold has one solution - you have to be in completely different modes of the product for creating vs. browsing documents. We donï¿½t do that. But there are some consequences, because we have some features that make a lot of sense for authoring but little sense for browsing. Itï¿½s a tough problem to figure out when someone opens an arbitrary document what they intend to do with it.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Another goal is that file format (HTML, DOC, etc.) and connection type (LAN, HTTP, etc.) should be completely irrelevant and transparent to the end user. Thereï¿½s some degree of hype in the media that implies that users really care about these differences, but a company profile is a company profile, and the user shouldnï¿½t have to go through completely different steps to create it depending on what audience itï¿½s going to and what kind of network itï¿½s going to be viewed on. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Another issue for us is graceful degradation. First, graceful degradation into HTML; Word currently supports a huge number of formatting, drawing, page layout, and similar features which have no corresponding representation in HTML. We need to handle that well. Second, in general for on-line documents, specifically on-line document elements should do something reasonable when you print the document.
