<TABLE border=10><TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+2>Isaac Langsam</FONT> (c1870 - Feb 28, 1948), son of Harry and Breindel, married Tillie Guter (c.1872 - 1959) of Hungary. They lived in Philadelphia, PA and had four known children. His death record and cemetery record both give his name as Israel, not Isaac. Isaac/Israel was living at 2215 N. 29th Street when he passed away. He came to the USA in 1890. Their final resting place is at Roosevelt Memorial Park at Feastervl Trvs, PA. Suzan Wynne believes that Isaac was a brother to <a href="hrshelka.htm">Hersh Langsam</a>.
