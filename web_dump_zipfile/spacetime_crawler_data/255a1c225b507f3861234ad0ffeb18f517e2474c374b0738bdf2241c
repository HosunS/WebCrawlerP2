vertices s, a, b, c, and t, and the following edges:
- an edge from s to a with capacity 10
- an edge from s to c with capacity 5
- an edge from a to b with capacity 8
- an edge from b to c with capacity 4
- an edge from b to t with capacity 3
- an edge from c to a with capacity 2
- an edge from c to t with capacity 6

(1) Suppose that we have a flow from s to t in G that sends two units of
flow along a single path s-c-a-b-t. Draw the residual graph for this
flow. [NOTE: an earlier version of the homework said that the path was
s-c-a-b-c -- that was a typo.]

(2) What is the shortest augmenting path in the residual graph?

(3) Find and show a maximum flow from s to t and a minimum cut
separating s to t. The total amount of flow (that is, the amount of flow
on the edges going out of s, or on the edges going in to t) and the
total amount of the cut (the total capacity of the edges from the s side
of the cut to the t side of the cut) should be equal -- what are these
values?

(4) Suppose that it is near the end of the baseball season. Each of the
four teams in the American League West (the Angels, the Athletics, the
Mariners, and the Rangers) has three more games to play, one against
each other team. The Angels can win the division if they win all three
of their games and each other team wins at most one other game.

(a) Draw a maximum flow problem in which the maximum flows correspond to
scenarios in which the Angels can win the division. Your flow problem
should have a source vertex, a vertex for each of the non-Angel games,
and a vertex for each other team; the flow amount from a game vertex to
a team vertex should be 1 in a scenario where that team wins that game,
and 0 otherwise.

(b) Can the Angels still win, or have they already been eliminated?
