      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lectures will meet on Thursday, September 28.  Lab sections begin meeting on Monday, October 2.  For more information about meeting times of lab sections, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="Notes">Notes and Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>Please note that a warm-up project, <a href="ProjectGuide/Project0A">Project #0A</a>, is due on Wednesday, October 4 at 11:59pm, so you're going to want to be sure to get off to an early start on that.</li>
