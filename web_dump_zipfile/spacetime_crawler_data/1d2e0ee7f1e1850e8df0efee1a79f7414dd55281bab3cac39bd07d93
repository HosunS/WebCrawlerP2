<H2>CompSci 260 - Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Fall, 2018 (Dillencourt)</H2>

<p>Required problems are to be submitted electronically, using GradeScope.
Click <a href="hwsubmission.html">here</a> for instructions for
submitting the homework.</p>

<p>For full credit, the homework must be submitted by the specified
date and time.
There will be a grace period of unspecified duration (typically a few hours)
during which the homework may still be submitted, with a 20% penalty.
Once the grace period has expired, homework will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The non-requred additional problems
do not need to be turned in. 
However, they are highly recommended.
For the midterm and final exams, I will assume that you have
made an attempt to solve them.
</p>

<p>Some of the problems are straightforward. Others are more challenging.
They are intended to help you learn the material by applying it.
This works best if you make a serious attempt to solve them yourself.
If instead of trying to solve them yourself you prefer to ignore them,
obtain solutions from a friend, or look them up on the internet,
that is your choice.</p>
