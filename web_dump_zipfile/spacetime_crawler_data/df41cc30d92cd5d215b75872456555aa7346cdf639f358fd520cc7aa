Moishe,

Hi,

Don't have much information on the Langsam family. Esther Langsam married my
great grandfather Samual Jacobs. Esther was born March 16, 1870 in Austria. Her
father's name
(from death cert) is Schiea Langsam, and mother is Riva Chaia (I hope I've
spelled them right). Esther is buried in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, NY (Long
Island). She
is the only Langsam in my tree as she married into the Jacobs family. You can
see my family tree at: http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/3293/ .

At the time of her death, she lived at 1002 Foster Ave, Brooklyn, NY. Prior to
that at 1283 Ocean Ave., Brooklyn, NY. That's all I have. Maybe it will help.
Let me know.

Allison

Moishe,


Hi, I don't know much about that side of the family. I sent your email to a
cousin who may know this. I have a copy of Esther's death certificate, and on
it is her father's name; it is Schiea Langsam. If you like, I'll scan it and
send you a copy. As for the other names, I don't recognize any of them. I'll
let you know what my cousin says when I receive her email back. Do you live in
NY? I am in Michigan. I was born and raised in NY.

Hi,


My cousin says she does not know what Esther's father's name was. But, it is
possible that her father's name was Isaac, because two of Esther's sons (Irving
- Ruby's husband and Abe) middle name is Isaac. She suggested that I ask my
Uncle (Esther's grandson) since he is just about the oldest now. I will email
his daughter and find out. This may take a while, but I will let you know what
happens. I'm saving your email address and phone numbers in my address book.
Have you looked at the death cert? Is your Esther's husbands name Samual? If
so, we may have a connection here. Good luck!!

Well Moishe, I think we're indirectly in the same line. Nice to find
someone out there who is related some how! How old are you? I'll be 48
in June. The last place I lived in Brooklyn was on E. 29th St. between
Kings Highway and Ave. P. I went to James Madison HS. My dad is Stanton
White (Rose's son); don't know if you know the name. Below I've tried to
answer as good as possible your questions. Hope it helps you.



Yes, the Esther listed is wife of Samuel, with daughter-in-law Ruby.
*Ruby was married to Irving. Irving is buried in Beth David Cemetery in
Elmont, NY (Long Island). There is a Jacobs/White plot (big section near
the front entrance). Esther's daughter Rose (Jacobs) White (my
grandmother) is buried there (on the White side). Esther & Samual are
buried there (on the Jacobs side), along with their son Abe, his wife
Molly, and their son Mitchell (who died young); Esther and Samual's
daugther Leah (Jacobs) and her husband Simon Lieberman are also buried
there.


I think they made a mistake although it won't be the first time I saw a
death certificate with the wrong data.
*Well, his name could have been changed at Ellis Island, or translated
to Issac.


If you are contacting this uncle, the other important question to ask is
WHAT OTHER LANGSAM'S DO YOU KNOW? Any of Esther's sibling's names or
their children? Then we can really put this tree where it belongs.
*Do you know any of Esther's siblings?


Also, from where in Europe were they?
*The 1920 census says Samual and Esther came from Austria. Funny, it
also says they spoke Polish!


Do you have their marriage record? Were they married in the USA? Her
death record implies she came here when she was 24. Did she already have
kids?
*I don't have a marriage record, but they were married in Austria (or
wherever). My Grandmother Rose was born in Austria along with her sister
Gussie. The rest of the four children were born in the US. According to
the 1920 census, they came to the US in 1899.


Also, it says she was naturalized. Do you have the  records pertaining
to that? If not, would you like me to try and get that for you from the
NARA here or Brooklyn Supreme Court? If so, do you know where they lived
before 1002 Foster Ave (which is right near me).
*Also according to the 1920 census, it says they (Samual, Esther, and
Gussie) were naturalized in 1905. Women were naturalized when the
husband/father was. By 1920, Rose (my grandmother) was married and had
two children (my uncle and my dad), and living in Wisconsin. Also
according to the 1920 census, their address was 670 (?) Rockaway Ave,
Kings County. I do not have the naturalization papers. Haven't been able
to find them yet.


I would send a scanned copy of the census, but it is very dark and hard
to read. I am attaching copys of photos I took at the cemetery; have
others, will send tomorrow. Happy researching... will be in touch.

don't know anything about her brothers or sisters. I'll ask around again if

Moishe,


I have sent an email to my cousin Naomi to see if she recalls the 
names Saul &amp; Rebecca Langsam. In her email to you, she said she 
remembered names like Willy, Phil, and Nat. I see that they are sons 
of David. She also said that maybe they were cousins to Esther. So 
either they were cousins or she was their aunt. Have to do more 
research.


I have a GEDCOM file that I will send you in the next few days. My 
computer is having "a snit", and I have been working on it. I know 
that my Family Treemaker file is still there, just not sure if it will 
fit on a disk; may have to zip it to get it to another computer.


Take care,

Samuel Jacobsï¿½ father is Avraham Yitzchok (Abraham Isaac).  Samuelï¿½s Hebrew name 
is Shabbatai.

I canï¿½t quite make out Simon Liebermanï¿½s Hebrew name, Iï¿½m going to ask someone

Also, I had another childï¿½thereï¿½s Julia Rachel (Yael Rina), and now Hannah Mia

Hi,

To see the tombstones and death certificate, you can review
the page in my website at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/estrlang.htm

I think that this Yeshaya was a brother to Isaac Langsam.
You can review that data at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/saul.htm

I am still in Flatbush and am still trying to "attach" your
branch to the main tree. Any resources you can direct me to
or supply that might help would be most welcome. Are you
aware of any other LANGSAM cousins that Esther Jacobs may
have told some of your family about?

Not a one, unfortunately. Everyone in my parents' family was niftar before
I was born. I only knew one grandparent, and that was on my father's side.
What I know of my mother's family comes from Ally.

Moishe,

As I was organizing my Israel notes and integrating material, I realized
that I never sent you the additional information I developed on a possible
link to H9. The issue at hand was how Esther Jacobs (of Ruby and Allison
White fame) fits in. Before I left for Israel, I was playing around with
various Jewish sites and found cemetery records for Beth David in Queens.

Ruby Jacobs thought that Esther was the daughter of Isaac and Gittel but
she was the daughter of Abraham Langsam. Esther did marry Samuel Jacobs and
they had a bunch of children as your correspondence with Allison White
indicated. I have no quarrel with the tree as she provided it except that
Esther was a daughter of Abraham. Esther was born 3/1/1870 which would
place Abraham with a birthdate at least 20 years before.

Either the stone and cemetery records are incorrect and she really was a
daughter to Isaac and Gittel in H9 or she belongs elsewhere.

 Hi,

 Welcome back!!! I missed you; I have been hard at work
 trying to coallate all my various notes, emails and

 Regarding H9, please clarify what you mean by "Ruby Jacobs

 but
 she was the daughter of Abraham Langsam"

 Which ABRAHAM LANGSAM do you mean???

 I have my own pet theory - Esther Jacobs was a sister to
 Isaac, not a daughter. Furthermore, I think that H9 and H8
 connect via the Schia reference on Esther's death
 certifiacte (see it at:
 http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/pic/pcertejc.jpg)

 Please share your thoughts and comments!

Now that IS interesting. The cemetery record has her father as Abraham. If
the death record is correct, and I have no reason to suspect that it is not,
then the task is to figure out who Schaya and Riva Chaia are. Yours is an
interesting theory. For now, as I have counseled before, I think she ought
to be treated separately. We may never be able to solve this little
mystery.

Moishe,
 
Hi, just got back from a four week business/vacation trip. I will forward you something this evening. Will you send me what you have as far as ancestors of my line? I've been at a stand still for quite a while; looking for more info to continue.
 
Thanks,
Ally
