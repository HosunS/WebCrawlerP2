Hi,
Saw your research posting on JewishGen. Does your family have a Langsam 
connection? In our tree we have a Tomberg married to Rosie Langsam (born 
about 1893), daughter of Isaac and Tille of Philadelphia, PA. Isaac was 
from Austria (Galicia?). Rosie and this Tomberg had three sons:
Joseph, a judge in Florida
Saul, an attorney
Sidney, testing airplanes in Dayton, OH

Does any of this sound familiar?

Rosie was married to Izzy (my paternal uncle). They spent most of their
lives in Wilkes Barre PA, where they owned an electrical supply company that
stills bears their name Tomberg. There is indeed a connection. Rosie and
Izzy moved to FL and bought a liquor store.  There is a short autobiography
on my website

Hi,
Do you have more information about your uncle Izzy? Something more about 
his children and their descendents? Pictures? Are any of them still living? 
I am trying to find out more about where Rosie's father came from.

Thanks so much and a Happy New Year!

A happy and healthy new year to you and yours
 
We have not been all that close.  I know Joe is married to Roberta and they 
have 2 sons, Jeff (an attorney in Boynton Beach FL) and Mark who is the 
landscape business also in the area.
 
Sid has a son James a professor of mathematics at Duke (he has a website).  
Sid who was an attorney for a short time after graduation did not like law 
and became a TV repairman.
 
Saul was in real estate in North Palm Beach and has a daughter Debbie, who 
was quite a renowned diver in her younger years.  
 
You may want to contact my older sister, Phyllis who may be of more help - 
E-mail:   Momgig@aol.com.
As an aside, Sid's sister Midge (now deceased was the sister of my wife's 
first cousin's husband in Wilkes Barre.

Hi,

I am contacting you at your brother's direction (see the chain of emails below). 
Would you know much regarding your aunt Rosie Tomberg, nee Langsam? Any contact 
with her offspring? Did she have four children, Joe, Sid, Saul and Midge?

Wishing you a Happy New Year,

Dear Moishe, 

I believe my Aunt Rose and her husband had three sons that you named. Midge was 
a daughter-in-law. Jeff Tomberg who is Joseph's son  is a lawyer and lives in 
Boynton beach FL. His address is: Jeff Tombrg 
                    P.O. Box EE 
                   Boynton Beach, Fl33425 
Shalom, 

Phyllis Giglio

Hi,
I am contacting you through Stan Tomberg's assistance. We are distant cousins via 
the LANGSAM family (your wife's father's mother - Saul's mother Rosie). Would you 
perhaps be interested in exploring this in more detail? I maintain a website 
regarding our extended family at
www.langsam.com
and would greatly appreciate your input. I am primarily interested in your grandmother's 
ancestry. I am trying to connect your branch to our tree. Knowing about Rosie's father's 
ancestry (parent's or siblings) should make this connection possible. Was she born in 
Philadelphia or Europe. Did her father marry in the USA or Europe? Where in Europe was 
her father from? Do you know of any LANGSAM cousins at your grandmother's generational 
level? 

Wishing you a Happy Jewish New Year,
Moishe Miller
