Dear Moishe Miller,

Thank you for your message. My former colleague forwarded your message
to me. I'm happy to check the Langsam web site. I'll also tell my 
father. I'd heard about Pesach Langsam before. I assume that he's 
the first one to take the Langsam surname.

Thank you,

Barbara Langsam Shuman (see more detail <a href="shuman.htm">here</a>)

Hi,

Thanks for your reply. Can you tell me more about your ancestry? Who is 
the earliest LANGSAM in your line that you know of. From where was this 
person from.

Also, to ease your navigation within the website, you can go directly to 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/langsam.htm

Moishe -- sorry about that.  The earliest Langsam that I know of would be 
my grandfather's father, whose name was Shuel, or Shoel. My father was 
named after him and my father's Hebrew name is pronounced (as he was 
called and pronounces it, I suppose it's the Yiddish form) Shoel.  My 
grandfather was born in 1890, in a village near Vienna in what was then 
part of  Austro-Hungary.  He came to this country in 1906 and settled in 
the St. Louis area.

Take care,

Barbara

Hi,
I think I found your branch. Do you have a brother David? Is your mother 
Esther? Was your grandfather also David?

Dear Moishe,

Yes, my brother's name is David and he was named for my grandfather (I 
should have included his name before). And yes, my mother's name is 
Esther. 

And yes, Harry Langsam was my grandfather's older brother. And yes, his 
offspring are our cousins and we know them well.  My grandfather had 
another brother, Morris, who married Rose (I think maiden name Fish). 
She was my grandmother's aunt. My grandmother was Flora Fish, and I think 
her mother's maiden name was Spira, which I see is a family name of other 
Langsam relatives. I know that my grandparents came from the same area in 
Europe.

How did Pesach Langsam take the surname "Langsam"?  You know that it is 
German for "slowly". Was your direct ancestor a Miller by profession? I know 
that that's how many surnames were adopted then.

Best,

Barbara
