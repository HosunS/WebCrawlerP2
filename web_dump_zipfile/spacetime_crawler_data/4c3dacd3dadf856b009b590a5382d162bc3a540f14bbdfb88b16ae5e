Implement a 2-input 2-output 8-bit div/mod sequential entity in VHDL. Use
the div/mod algorithm introduced in lecture for performing the operations.
Remember that your div/mod entity should contain the datapath and the
controller entities.

Implement an exhaustive testbench for your div/mod sequential entity in
VHDL.

Simulate your testbench and div/mod entity and show the wave-forms of input
and output signals to your TA. Make sure your TA checks out your demo. This
will be worth 70% of the points for this project.

Complete a report and attach to it all source VHDL files. Your report should
include your name, a description of the VHDL files attached, any special
notes or comments, and a description of how you tested your design. Also, your
report should contain the datapath drawing and controller FSM. How many clock
cycles does your processor take to compute one div/mod operation?

Your TA will provide you with information on tools, lab setup, and other things
related to this project. Make sure you seek help to get you started.
