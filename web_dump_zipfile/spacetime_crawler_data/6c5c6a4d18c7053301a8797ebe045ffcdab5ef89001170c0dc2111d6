<H2> Documentation standards </H2>

Documentation serves as an essential interface between programmers
working together, and as the main interface between the final product
and the naive user.&nbsp;
Since documentation is designed to communicate,
it should be clear and unambiguous.
<P>
Documentation should be coherent.&nbsp;
Breaking the documentation up into
distinct sections which describe different aspects of the program
increases clarity.&nbsp;
Writing in grammatically correct sentences with
correctly spelled words increases readability.
<P>
<H3> Internal documentation </H3>

Internal documentation should be concise.&nbsp;
Variable names should be defined;&nbsp;
arbitrary or "magic" numbers should be explained;&nbsp;
and sections of code should be described.&nbsp;
Descriptive variable names are
necessary as an addition to both the documentation and readability of
the program.

<H3> External documentation </H3>

External documentation should include descriptions of the following:
<UL>
<LI> How to use the final product.
<LI> The type of input you expect and the
     type of output you will generate.
<LI> The type of errors handled and the action
     taken on each type of error. 
<LI> All special features which you implemented
     which were not specified for the lab. 
<LI> Any design choices which you made and reasons for these choices. 
<LI> Any special files needed to run the program.
</UL>

<P>
<I>Note</I>:&nbsp;  Your name should be inside each file that
you write.&nbsp;
Be careful to cite any sources from which you derived your work.
<P>
