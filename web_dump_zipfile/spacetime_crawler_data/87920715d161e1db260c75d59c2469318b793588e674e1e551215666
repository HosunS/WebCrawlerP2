<h1>
A New Property and a Faster Algorithm for Baseball Elimination
</h1>
<h2>
Edwin Solares
</h2>
<p>In the baseball elimination problem, there is a league consisting of n
teams. At some point during the season, team&nbsp;<i>i</i>
has <i>w<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;wins and <i>g<sub>ij</sub></i>&nbsp;games
left to play against team&nbsp;<i>j</i>. A team is eliminated if it
cannot possibly finish the season in first place or tied for first
place. The goal is to determine exactly which teams are eliminated. The
problem is not as easy as many sports writers would have you believe, in
part because the answer depends not only on the number of games won and
left to play but also on the schedule of remaining games. In the 1960's,
Schwartz showed how to determine whether one particular team is
eliminated using a maximum flow computation.  This paper indicates that
the problem is not as difficult as many mathematicians would have you
believe. For each team&nbsp;<i>i</i>, let <i>g<sub>i</sub></i> denote
the number of games remaining. We prove that there exists a
value <i>W</i> such that team&nbsp;<i>i</i> is eliminated if and only if
<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>g<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>W</i>.
Using this surprising fact, we can determine all eliminated teams in
time proportional to a single maximum flow computation in a graph
with <i>n</i>&nbsp;nodes; this improves upon the previous best known
complexity bound by a factor of&nbsp;<i>n</i>.</p>
