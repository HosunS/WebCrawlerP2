			  Ten Talking Points

1.  Practice, practice, practice.

2.  A clear talk comes from a clear short sequence of main ideas.
Tell a simple story.

3.  Overview, preview, view, review.

4.  Slides: Pictures, not text; brief phrases, not sentences.
The content delivery is you talking, not text on your slides.

5.  Don't bog down in the Intro; it is later than you think.
Time is always too short.

6.  Relate your talk to AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM, even if indirect.

7.  Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end:
Intro, content, summary.

8.  Tell only the most interesting details, and
control talk length by controlling detail depth.
To shorten or speed up a talk, say fewer details.

9.  Make eye contact with someone in your audience,
relax, and speak directly to them; then make eye
contact with someone else, and repeat.

10. Practice, practice, practice.
