First, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion. Second, a set of simple holistic features is extracted from each segmented region, and the correspondence between features and the number of people per segment is learned with Gaussian Process regression. We validate both the crowd segmentation algorithm, and the crowd counting system, on a large pedestrian dataset (2000 frames of video, containing 49,885 total pedestrian instances).  Finally, we present results of the system running on a full hour of video.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">The computational complexity of current visual categorization algorithms scales linearly at best with the number of categories. The goal of classifying simultaneously Ncat=10^4-10^5 visual categories requires sub-linear classification costs. We explore algorithms for automatically building classification trees which have, in principle, log Ncat complexity. We find that a greedy algorithm that recursively splits the set of categories into the two minimally confused subsets achieves 5-20 fold speedups at a small cost in classification performance. Our approach is independent of the specific classification algorithm used. A welcome by-product of our algorithm is a very reasonable taxonomy of the Caltech-256 dataset.</TD>

This talk will start with a quick overview of the range of research activities in the Computer Vision Group at JPL, then address our current main focus of work for NASA, which is visual navigation for landers and balloons in planetary exploration.  Under DARPA and Army sponsorship, we are addressing (1) real-time detection and tracking of people around unmanned ground vehicles for safety, (2) self-supervised learning of terrain traversability, and (3) physics-based terrain classification of water and mud hazards for off-road driving.  For planetary landers, desired capabilities include real-time, onboard landmark recognition for precision landing, feature tracking for terrain-relative velocity estimation, and landing hazard detection.  We are addressing these functions using mono or stereo visible spectrum imagery, as well as lidar, with FPGAs as the primary approach to real-time implementation in space. The main possibility for a balloon mission is to Saturn's moon Titan, which is about the size of our moon but has an atmosphere 1.5x denser than Earth's.  Titan's atmosphere admits visible imaging of the surface from a balloon, but from orbit the surface is only resolvable in near infrared or radar wavelengths.  Therefore, we are developing methods for balloon position estimation that match visible imagery from a balloon to maps created with orbital near infrared or radar imagery.  Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) on Earth have some visual navigation problems that are closely related to those for planetary landers and balloons, so one of our future goals is to broader our work on vision for planetary landers to address UAV navigation as well.

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Zhuowen Tu</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">The notion of using {\em context} information for solving the high-level vision problems and medical imaging tasks has been increasingly realized in the field. However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with the image appearance, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design, in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose an {\bf auto-context} algorithm. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates to approach the ground truth. Auto-context learns an integrated low-level and context model, and is very general and easy to implement. It selects and fuses a large number of low-level appearance features, with implicit context and shape information, through a sequence of discriminative models. Under nearly an identical parameter setting in training, we apply the algorithm on three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where  the anatomical structures are mostly positioned and constrained. With only some slight changes from using 2D to 3D features, the auto-context algorithm applied  in brain imaging is shown to outperform many the  state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for brain MRI image segmentation. Further, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems of multi-variate labeling.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) provides a framework for training a discriminative classifier from data with ambiguous labels. This framework is well suited for the task of learning object classifiers from weakly labeled image data, where only the presence of an object in an image is known, but not its location. Some recent work has explored the application of MIL algorithms to the tasks of image categorization and natural scene classification. In this paper we extend these ideas in a framework that uses MIL to recognize and localize objects in images. To achieve this we employ state of the art image descriptors and multiple stable segmentations. These components, combined with a powerful MIL algorithm, form our object recognition system called MILSS. We show highly competitive object categorization results on the Caltech dataset. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm further, we introduce the challenging Landmarks-18 dataset, a collection of photographs of famous landmarks from around the world. The results on this new dataset show the great potential of our proposed algorithm.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">I will describe a method for organizing multiple visual categories into a taxonomy. Such organization becomes crucial as the number of available categories increases. The proposed method extends current non-parametric Bayesian techniques such as Nested Chinese Restaurant Process (NCRP). The method is completely unsupervised. It discovers commonalities among images and exploits these commonalities to represent images compactly in a hierarchical manner. Visual categories emerge and become organized in a taxonomy automatically during this process.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Nikhil Rasiwasia Nuno Vasconcelos</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Current image retrieval techniques have difficulties to retrieve images which exhibit distinct visual patterns but belong to the class of the query image. Previous attempts to improve 'generalization' have shown that the introduction of semantic representations can mitigate this problem.  We extend the existing query-by-semantic-example (QBSE) retrieval paradigm by adding a second layer of semantic representation. At the first level, the representation is driven by patch-based visual features.  Semantic concepts, from a pre-defined vocabulary, are modeled as Gaussian mixtures on a visual feature space, and images as vectors of posterior probabilities of containing each of the semantic concepts.  At the second level, the representation is purely semantic. Semantic concepts are modeled as Dirichlet mixtures on the semantic feature space of QBSE, and images are again represented as vectors of posterior concept probabilities. The proposed retrieval strategy, is able to cope with the ambiguities of patch-based classification, exhibiting significantly better generalization than previous methods.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Piotr Dollar, Boris Babenko, Serge Belongie, Pietro Perona and Zhuowen Tu </TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Object detection is one of the key problems in computer vision. In the last decade, discriminative learning approaches have proven effective in detecting rigid objects, achieving very low false positives rates. The field has also seen a resurgence of part-based recognition methods, with impressive results on highly articulated, diverse object categories. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning approach for detection that is inspired by part-based recognition approaches. Our method, Multiple Component Learning (MCL), automatically learns individual component classifiers and combines these into an overall classifier. Unlike previous methods, which rely on either fairly restricted part models or labeled part data, MCL learns powerful component classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, where object labels are provided but part labels are not. The basis of MCL lies in learning a set classifier; we achieve this by combining boosting with weakly supervised learning, specifically the Multiple Instance Learning framework (MIL). MCL is general, and we demonstrate results on a range of data from computer audition and computer vision. In particular, MCL outperforms all existing methods on the challenging INRIA pedestrian detection dataset, and unlike methods that are not part-based, MCL is quite robust to occlusions. </TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">Actions in real world applications typically take place in cluttered environments with large variations in the orientation and scale of the actor. We present an approach to simultaneously track and recognize known actions that is robust to such variations, starting from a person detection in the standing pose. In our approach we first render synthetic poses from multiple viewpoints using Mocap data for known actions and represent them in a Conditional Random Field(CRF) whose observation potentials are computed using shape similarity and the transition potentials are computed using optical flow. We enhance these basic potentials with terms to represent spatial and temporal constraints and call our enhanced model the Shape,Flow,Duration- Conditional Random Field(SFD-CRF). We find the best sequence of actions using Viterbi search in the SFD-CRF. We demonstrate our approach on videos from multiple viewpoints and in the presence of background clutter.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE">We observe that everyday images contain dozens of objects, and that humans, in describing these images, give different priority to these objects. We argue that a goal of visual recognition is, therefore, not only to detect and classify objects but also to associate with each a level of priority which we call &lsquo;importance&rsquo;. We propose a definition of importance and show how this may be estimated reliably from data harvested from human observers. We conclude by showing that a first-order estimate of importance may be computed from a number of simple image region measurements and does not require access to image meaning.</TD>
