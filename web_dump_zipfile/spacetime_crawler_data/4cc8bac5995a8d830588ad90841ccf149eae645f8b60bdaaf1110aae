Please divide 100 points between your teammates 
according to their level of participation in your 
team's project. Do not assign any points to 
yourself -- just to your team members. If you feel 
all members have contributed equally, then assign 
each team member an equal number of points. 
If on the other hand, you feel that one member did 
far more work than all others and one member was 
not helpful, you might, for example, give the 
more active member more points, the less active 
member fewer points, and the other members the 
same, average number of points. Please try to be 
fair.<BR>
<BR>
Also comment <B>briefly</B> on each team member's 
performance. Your evaluation should focus on 
standard evaluation criteria, such as technical 
competence, effort, productivity, creativity, 
quality, dependability, communication, initiative, 
decision making, and leadership.  Please assign a 
number between 1-5, 1 being best ("outstanding"), 
3 being ok ("meets requirements"), 5 being worst 
("unsatisfactory") for each teammate, for each 
of the attributes.<BR><BR>
