      <h2>2. TIFF and Fax</h2><a name="sub1"></a><h3>2.1. TIFF Overview</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            TIFF provides a means for describing, storing and interchanging
            raster image data. A primary goal of TIFF is to provide a rich
            environment within which applications can exchange image data. The
            current TIFF specification [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>] defines a commonly used, core set
            of TIFF fields known as Baseline TIFF. The current specification and
            TIFF Technical Notes 1 and 2 [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>, <a title="Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt" href="chapter11.html#TTN2">TTN2</a>] define several TIFF
            extensions. The TIFF- based specification for fax applications uses a
            subset of Baseline TIFF fields, with selected extensions, as
            described in this document. In a few cases, this document defines new
            TIFF fields specifically for fax applications.
         
      </p>
      <a name="sub1sub1"></a><h3>2.1.1. File Structure</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            TIFF is designed for raster images, which makes it a good match for
            facsimile documents, which are multi-page raster images. Each raster
            image consists of a number of rows or scanlines, each of which has
            the same number of pixels, the unit of sampling. Each pixel has at
            least one sample or component (exactly one for black-and-white
            images).
         
      </p>
      <p>
            A TIFF file begins with an 8-byte image file header. The first two
            bytes describe the byte order used within the file. Legal values are
            "II" (0x4949) when bytes are ordered from least to most significant
            (little- endian), and "MM" (0x4D4D), when bytes are ordered from most
            to least significant (big-endian) within a 16- or 32-bit integer.
            Either byte order can be used, except in the case of the minimal
            black-and-white mode, which SHALL use value "II". The next two bytes
            contain the value 42 that identifies the file as a TIFF file and is
            ordered according to the value in the first two bytes of the header.
            The last four bytes give the offset that points to the first image
            file directory (IFD). This and all other offsets in a TIFF file are
            with respect to the beginning of the TIFF file. An IFD can be at any
            location in the file after the header but must begin on a word
            boundary.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            An IFD is a sequence of tagged fields, sorted in ascending order by
            tag value. An IFD consists of a 2-byte count of the number of fields,
            a sequence of field entries and a 4-byte offset to the next IFD. The
            fields contain information about the image and pointers to the image
            data. Each separate raster image in the file is represented by an
            IFD.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Each field entry in an IFD has 12 bytes and consists of a 2-byte Tag,
            2 bytes identifying the field type (e.g. short, long, rational,
            ASCII), 4 bytes giving the count (number of values or offsets), and 4
            bytes that either contain the offset to a field value stored outside
            the IFD, or, based on the type and count, the field value itself.
            Resolution and metadata such as dates, names and descriptions are
            examples of "long" field values that do not fit in 4 bytes and
            therefore use offsets in the field entry. Details are given in the
            TIFF specification [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p>
            A TIFF file can contain more than one IFD, where each IFD is a
            subfile whose type is given in the NewSubfileType field. Multiple
            IFDs can be organized either as a linked list, with the last entry in
            each IFD pointing to the next IFD (the pointer in the last IFD is 0),
            or as a tree, using the SubIFDs field in the primary IFD [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>]. The
            SubIFDs field contains an array of pointers to child IFDs of the
            primary IFD.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Child IFDs describe related images, such as reduced resolution
            versions of the primary IFD image. The same IFD can point both to a
            next IFD and to child IFDs, and child IFDs can themselves point to
            other IFDs.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            All fax modes represent a multi-page fax image as a linked list of
            IFDs, with a NewSubfileType field containing a bit that identifies
            the IFD as one page of a multi-page document. Each IFD has a
            PageNumber field, identifying the page number in ascending order,
            starting at 0 for the first page. While a Baseline TIFF reader is not
            required to read any IFDs beyond the first, an implementation that
            reads the files that comply with this specification SHALL read
            multiple IFDs. Only the Mixed Raster Content fax mode, described in
            Section 8, requires the use of child IFDs.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            The following figure illustrates the structure of a multi-page TIFF
            file.

</pre>
      
      <a name="sub1sub2"></a><h3>2.1.2. Image Structure</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            An IFD stores an image as one or more strips, as shown in the
            preceding figure. A strip consists of 1 or more scanlines (rows) of
            raster image data in compressed form. An image may be stored in a
            single strip or may be divided into several strips, which would
            require less memory to buffer. (Baseline TIFF recommends about 8k
            bytes per strip, but existing fax usage is typically one strip per
            image.)
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Each IFD requires three strip-related fields: StripOffsets,
            RowsPerStrip and StripByteCounts. The StripOffsets field is an array
            of pointers to the strip or strips that contain the actual image
            data. The StripByteCounts field gives the number of bytes in each
            strip after compression. TIFF requires that each strip, except the
            last, contain the same number of scanlines, which is given in the
            RowsPerStrip field. This document introduces the new StripRowCounts
            field that allows a variable number of scanlines per strip, which is
            required by the Mixed Raster Content fax mode (Section 8).
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Image data is stored as uninterpreted, compressed image data streams
            within a strip. The formats of these streams follow the ITU-T
            Recommendations. The Compression field in the IFD indicates the type
            of compression, and other TIFF fields in the IFD describe image
            attributes, such as color encoding and spatial resolution.
            Compression parameters are stored in the compressed data stream,
            rather than in TIFF fields. This makes the TIFF representation and
            compressed data format specification independent of each another.
            This approach, modeled on [<a title="Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt" href="chapter11.html#TTN2">TTN2</a>], allows TIFF to gracefully add new
            compression schemes as they become available.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Some attributes can be specified both in the compressed data stream
            and within a TIFF field. It is possible that the two values will
            differ. When this happens for values required to interpret the data
            stream, then the values in the data stream take precedence. For
            informational values that are not required to interpret the data
            stream, such as author name, then the TIFF field value takes
            precedence.
         
      </p>
      
      <a name="sub1sub3"></a><h3>2.1.3. TIFF File Structure for Fax Applications</h3>
      
      
      <p>
            The TIFF specification has a very flexible file structure, which does
            not specify the ordering of IFDs, field values and image data in a
            file. Individual applications may require or recommend an ordering.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            This specification recommends that when using a TIFF file for
            facsimile, A multi-page fax document SHOULD be represented as a
            linked list of IFDs. It also recommends that a TIFF file for
            facsimile SHOULD order pages in a TIFF file in the same way that they
            are ordered in a fax data stream. In a TIFF file, a page consists of
            several elements: one or more IFDs (including subIFDs), long field
            values that are stored outside the IFDs, and image data (in one or
            more strips).
         
      </p>
      <p>
            The minimal black-and-white mode (Profile S) specifies a required
            ordering of pages and elements within a page (Section 3.5). The
            extended black-and-white mode (Profile F) provides guidelines for
            ordering pages and page elements (Section 4.4.6). Other profiles
         
      </p>
      <p>
            SHOULD follow these guidelines. This recommendation is intended to
            simplify the implementation of TIFF writers and readers in fax
            applications and the conversion between TIFF file and fax data stream
            representations. However, for interchange robustness, readers SHOULD
            be prepared to read TIFF files whose structure is consistent with
            [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>], which supports a more flexible file structure than is
            recommended here.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            This specification introduces an optional new GlobalParametersIFD
            field, defined in Section 2.2.4. This field has type IFD and
            indicates parameters describing the fax session. While it is often
            possible to obtain these parameters by scanning the file, it is
            convenient to make them available together in one place for fast and
            easy access. If the GlobalParametersIFD occurs in a TIFF file, it
            SHOULD be located in the first IFD, immediately following the 8-byte
            image file header.

      <p>
            The TIFF specification [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>] is organized as a baseline set and
            several extensions, including technical notes [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>, <a title="Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt" href="chapter11.html#TTN2">TTN2</a>] that will
            be incorporated in the next release of TIFF. The baseline and
            extensions have required and optional fields.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            Facsimile applications require (and recommend) a mixture of baseline
            and extensions fields, as well as some new fields that are not part
            of the TIFF specification and that are defined in this document. This
            sub- section lists the fields that are required or recommended for
            all modes. In particular, Section 2.2.1 lists the fields that are
            required by all modes and that have values that do not depend on the
            mode. Section 2.2.2 lists the fields that are required by all modes
            and that have values which do depend on the mode. Section 2.2.3 lists
            the fields that are recommended for all modes. Fields that are
            required or recommended by some but not all modes are given in the
            section (Section 3-8) that describes that mode. The sections for each
            fax mode have sub-sections for required and recommended fields; each
            sub-section organizes the fields according to whether they are
            baseline, extension or new.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            The fields required for facsimile have only a few legal values,
            specified in the ITU-T Recommendations. Of these legal values, some
            are required and some are optional, just as they are required
            (mandatory) or optional in fax implementations that conform to the
            ITU-T Recommendations. The required and optional values are noted in
            the sections on the different fax modes.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            This section describes the fields required or recommended by all fax
            modes. The pattern for the description of TIFF fields in this draft
            is:
         
      </p>
      <pre>
FieldName(TagValueInDecimal) = allowable values.                    TYPE

</pre>
      <p>
            When a field's default value is the desired value, that field may be
            omitted from the relevant IFD unless specifically required by the

      <p>
            The TIFF fields listed in this section SHALL be used by all fax
            modes, but have field values that are not specified by the ITU
            standards, i.e. the fields do not depend on the mode. The next sub-
            section lists the fields that SHALL be used by all fax modes, but
            which do have values specified by the ITU-specified or mode-specific
            values. Fields that SHALL be used by some but not all modes are given
            in the sections (3-8) which describe the modes that uses them.

      <pre>
ImageLength(257)                                           SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Total number of scanlines in image.
    No default, must be specified.

PageNumber(297)                                                    SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFforFAX, TIFFExtension
    Count = 2
    The first number represents the page number (0 for the first page);
    the second number is the total number of pages in the document. If
    the second value is 0, then the total page count is not available.
    No default, must be specified

RowsPerStrip(278)                                          SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The number of scanlines per TIFF strip, except for the last strip.
    For a single strip image, this is the same as the value of the
    ImageLength field.
    Default = 2**32 - 1 (meaning all scanlines in one strip)

StripByteCounts(279)                                       SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Count = number of strips
    For each strip, the number of bytes in that strip after compression.

    No default, must be specified.

StripOffsets(273)                                          SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Count = number of strips
    For each strip, the byte offset from the beginning of the file to
    the start of that strip.
    No default, must be specified.

      <p>
            The TIFF fields listed in this section SHALL be used by all fax
            modes, but the values associated with them depend on the mode being
            described and the associated ITU Recommendations. Therefore, only the
            fields are defined here; the values applicable to a particular fax
            mode are described in Sections 3-8. Fields that SHALL be used by some
            but not all modes are given in the section (3-8) describing the mode
            that uses them.

BitsPerSample(258)                                                 SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Number of bits per image sample
    Default = 1 (field may be omitted if this is the value)

Compression(259)                                                   SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Compression method used for image data
    Default = 1 (no compression, so may not be omitted for FAX)

FillOrder(266)                                                     SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFforFax
    The default bit order in Baseline TIFF per [<a title="Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1" href="chapter11.html#TIFF">TIFF</a>] is indicated by
    FillOrder=1, where bits are not reversed before being stored.
    However, TIFF for Fax typically utilizes the setting of FillOrder=2,
    where the bit order within bytes is reversed before storage (i.e.,
    bits are stored with the Least Significant Bit first).
    Default = 1 (field may be omitted if this is the value)
    Facsimile data appears on the phone line in bit-reversed order
    relative to its description in the relevant ITU compression
    Recommendation. Therefore, a wide majority of facsimile
    implementations choose this natural order for storage. Nevertheless,
    all readers conforming to this specification must be able to read
    data in both bit orders.

ImageWidth(256)                                            SHORT or LONG
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The number of pixels (columns) per scanline (row) of the image
    No default, must be specified.

NewSubFileType(254)                                                 LONG
    RequiredByTIFFforFAX
    A general indication of the kind of data contained in this IFD
    Bit 1 is 1 if the image is a single page of a multi-page document.
    Default = 0 (no subfile bits on, so may not be omitted for FAX)

PhotometricInterpretation(262)                                     SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The color space of the image data
    No default, must be specified

ResolutionUnit(296)                                                SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The unit of measure for resolution. 2 = inch, 3 = centimeter;
    Default = 2 (field may be omitted if this is the value)

SamplesPerPixel(277)                                               SHORT
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The number of color components per pixel; SamplesPerPixel is 1 for a
    black-and-white, grayscale or indexed (palette) image.
    Default =1 (field may be omitted if this is the value)

XResolution(282)                                                RATIONAL
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The horizontal resolution of the image in pixels per resolution
    unit. The ITU-T Recommendations for facsimile specify a small number
    of horizontal resolutions: 100, 200, 300, 400 pixels per inch, and
    80, 160 pixels per centimeter (or 204, 408 pixels per inch). The
    allowed XResolution values for each mode are given in the section
    defining that mode. Per [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>], it is permissible for applications to
    treat the following XResolution values as being equivalent: &lt;204,
    200&gt; and &lt;400,408&gt; in pixels/inch. These equivalencies were allowed
    by [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>] to permit conversions between inch and metric based
    facsimile terminals.
    TIFF for Facsimile Writers SHOULD express XResolution in inch based
    units, for consistency with historical practice and to maximize
    interoperability. See the table below for information on how to
    convert from an ITU-T metric value to its inch based equivalent
    resolution.
    No default, must be specified

YResolution(283)                                                RATIONAL
    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    The vertical resolution of the image in pixels per resolution unit.
    The ITU-T Recommendations for facsimile specify a small number of
    vertical resolutions: 100, 200, 300, 400 pixels per inch, and 38.5,
    77, 154 pixels per centimeter (or 98, 196, 391 pixels per inch). The
    allowed YResolution values for each mode are given in the section
    defining that mode. Per [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>], it is permissible for applications to
    treat the following YResolution values as being equivalent: &lt;98,
    100&gt;, &lt;196, 200&gt;, and &lt;391, 400&gt; in pixels/inch. These equivalencies
    were allowed by [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>] to permit conversions between inch and metric
    based facsimile terminals. TIFF for Facsimile Writers SHOULD express
    YResolution in inch based units, for consistency with historical
    practice and to maximize interoperability. See the table below for

      <p>
            The TIFF fields listed in this section MAY be used by all fax modes.
            However, Profile S writers (the minimal fax mode described in Section
            3) SHOULD NOT use these fields. Recommended fields that are mode-
            specific are described in Sections 3-8.

      <p>
            The new TIFF fields listed in this section MAY be used by all fax
            modes, but their support is not expected for the minimal fax mode
            described in Section 3. In addition, support for these new TIFF
            fields has not been included in historical TIFF-F readers described
            in Section 4 and [<a title="Parsons, G. and J. Rafferty, &#34;Tag Image File Format (TIFF) - F Profile for Facsimile&#34;, RFC 2306, March 1998." href="chapter11.html#TIFF-FY">TIFF-FY</a>]. These fields describe "global" parameters
            of the fax session that created the image data. They are optional,
            not part of the current TIFF specification, and are defined in this
            document.
         
      </p>
      <p>
            The first new field, GlobalParametersIFD, is an IFD that contains
            global parameters and is located in a Primary IFD.
         
      </p>
      <pre>
GlobalParametersIFD (400)                                            IFD
    An IFD containing global parameters. It is recommended that a TIFF
    writer place this field in the first IFD, where a TIFF reader would
    find it quickly.

   Each field in the GlobalParametersIFD is a TIFF field that is legal
   in any IFD. Required baseline fields should not be located in the
   GlobalParametersIFD, but should be in each image IFD. If a conflict
   exists between fields in the GlobalParametersIFD and in the image
   IFDs, then the data in the image IFD shall prevail.

   Among the GlobalParametersIFD entries is a new ProfileType field
   which generally describes information in this IFD and in the TIFF
   file.

ProfileType(401)                                                    LONG
    The type of image data stored in this IFD.
    0 = Unspecified
    1 = Group 3 fax
    No default

   The following new global fields are defined in this document as IFD
   entries for use with fax applications.

FaxProfile(402) = 0 - 6.                                            BYTE
    The profile that applies to this file; a profile is subset of the
    full set of permitted fields and field values of TIFF for facsimile.
    The currently defined values are:
    0: does not conform to a profile defined for TIFF for facsimile
    1: minimal black &amp; white lossless, Profile S
    2: extended black &amp; white lossless, Profile F
    3: lossless JBIG black &amp; white, Profile J
    4: lossy color and grayscale, Profile C
    5: lossless color and grayscale, Profile L
    6: Mixed Raster Content, Profile M

CodingMethods(403)                                                  LONG
    This field indicates which coding methods are used in the file. A
    bit value of 1 indicates which of the following coding methods is
    used:
    Bit 0: unspecified compression,
    Bit 1: 1-dimensional coding, ITU-T Rec. T.4 (MH - Modified Huffman),
    Bit 2: 2-dimensional coding, ITU-T Rec. T.4 (MR - Modified Read),
    Bit 3: 2-dimensional coding, ITU-T Rec. T.6 (MMR - Modified MR),
    Bit 4: ITU-T Rec. T.82 coding, using ITU-T Rec. T.85 (JBIG),
    Bit 5: ITU-T Rec. T.81 (Baseline JPEG),
    Bit 6: ITU-T Rec. T.82 coding, using ITU-T Rec. T.43 (JBIG color),
    Bits 7-31: reserved for future use
    Note: There is a limit of 32 compression types to identify standard
    compression methods.

VersionYear(404)                                                    BYTE
    Count: 4
    The year of the standard specified by the FaxProfile field, given as
    4 characters, e.g. '1997'; used in lossy and lossless color modes.

ModeNumber (405)                                                    BYTE
    The mode of the standard specified by the FaxProfile field. A
    value of 0 indicates Mode 1.0; used in Mixed Raster Content mode.
