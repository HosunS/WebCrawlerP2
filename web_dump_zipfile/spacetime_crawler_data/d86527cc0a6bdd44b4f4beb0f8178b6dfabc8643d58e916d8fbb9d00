<H2> Timing on your computer </H2>
</center>

In order to determine the relative execution efficiency of various
algorithms, you will need to use a timer package.&nbsp;
I have available (see below) for your use such a package
written in C.&nbsp;
However, with advance approval from me, you may use other packages.
Note that CPU time is used by your program (user time)
as well as the system (system time).  We will be interested in
capturing the values of the user time usage only.
<P>
<B>A problem</B>:&nbsp;
On some systems, the timing function gives times in multiples
of .01 seconds.&nbsp;
On others, the timing coarseness may be
significantly smaller or larger.&nbsp;
(You should determine the timing coarseness for your machine.)&nbsp;
Thus, for example, on a system with .01 second timing coarseness,
timing anything which takes less than
one fiftieth of a second could result in more than a 50% error.&nbsp;
Your programs, for small values of <I>n</I>,
should be easily this fast.
<P>
<B>A solution</B>:&nbsp;
When the algorithm to be timed is too fast to obtain an accurate
measurement, the algorithm can be run many times in succession,
with the cumulative time being measured.&nbsp;
This time can then be divided by the number of runs to obtain a more
accurate measurement of the time required by an individual run.&nbsp;
<I>As little as possible</I>, other then the successive calls,
should occur while the timing is taking place.&nbsp;
<!--
In fact, for particularly speedy code, the time spent updating
the loop variable may be of the same order of magnitude as
the time you are attempting to measure.&nbsp;
To account for this, you can subsequently time the loop with
a (nearly) empty body and subtract this measure from your first measure,
the net result reflecting more accurately the time spent within
the code of interest.
One should note that some optimizing compilers will
optimize loops that contain an empty body by discarding them.
-->

<H3> Timer package </H3>

Program file <a href="timer.c"><tt>timer.c</tt></a> should be compiled
and linked with your program system.&nbsp;
It defines the following routines:
<UL>
<LI> <tt>user_time()</tt>
  <BR>
returns the total amount of user cpu time used by the current process
  <BR>
<LI> <tt>start_timer()</tt>
  <BR>
starts the timer
[actually, it only records the current value of <tt>user_time()</tt>]
  <BR>
<LI> <tt>elapsed_time()</tt>
  <BR>
returns the amount of cpu time that has been used since the last call
to <tt>start_timer()</tt>
</UL>
<P>
Header file <a href="timer.h"><tt>timer.h</tt></a>
declares the routines that are defined in <tt>timer.c</tt>
and it should be <tt>include</tt>d in all program files
that invoke any of those routines.

<P>
Note that the MinGW system does not have the proper version of <tt>include</tt> timing files.
If you were to try to compile the <tt>timer.c</tt> program file in MinGW,
you would get compilation errors.
Accordingly, for your own personal use (not to be used for course submissions),
you may make use of file <a href="timerMinGW.c"><tt>timerMinGW.c</tt></a> instead,
which I believe should work on the MinGW system.
