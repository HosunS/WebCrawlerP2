He was married twice &amp; had many children. Aside from his son Shabsi, whose descendants I know, all the other information comes from Slovak records. The 1869 census of Saros county lists Malachias M&uuml;ller married to Obidia Veifr (I could not read it clearly, but she was born 1819), living in Obrucna, Slovakia. It lists four of his children living with them at the time. Yakov Mylech's second wife is listed as Edel, not Obidia, on all of the birth records for her children.

	<LI><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Zlate (Zali)</B></FONT> (1825 - ?) lived in Obrucna, Slovakia. Information regarding her family comes from Slovak records. She married Marcus Weingarten of Obrucna, Slovakia. In the Slovak 1869 census of Saros county this record was found: Marcus Weingarten (born 1824) &amp; Zali M&uuml;ller had 6 children living with them at that time.

Additionally, I found multiple birth records for a son, Israel, in 3 separate volumes. The dates of birth were different in all three books; Jul 22, 1860; Aug 22, 1860; and Jan 4, 1862. I also found a record for Herman, born on Dec 1, 1865.
