Our research team is looking for a self-motivated undergraduate or MS
student for a research project. The main goal is to continue our
development of an add-on for the Thunderbird email client software. The
add-on will enable Thunderbird to do fuzzy keyword search on emails. We
currently have a prototype of the add-on and we are looking for a student
to finalize it and make it stable so that we can release it to the public
domain.  The student should be familiar with JavaScript and C++. Tutoring
and help would be provided.

We already released a couple of web services that include fuzzy-search
techniques developed by our team. One recent release is a people-search
service for the UCI campus called PSearch: http://psearch.ics.uci.edu/, a
joint effort with NACS. To get more information about our research, please
visit Prof. Chen Li's home page: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/ The
student can do the project as an indepdent study to earn credits.
Interested students can contact Prof. Chen Li (chenli AT ics dot uci.edu) directly.
