# This is version 1 of a program to find candidate genes on the given
# strand of DNA sequences.  This version takes its input from the user,
# who types the sequences in, one at a time.
#
# This program is broken into separate functions.  It does more than
# one job, so it's best to teach Python, separately, how to do each
# job by writing a function, then combine the functions together to
# complete the program.


# The printCandidateGenes function takes a DNA sequence as a parameter
# (i.e., as its input), finds any candidate genes using the rules we've
# used previously, then prints information about it.  For each, it prints
# the start position of the candidate gene, as well as its length (measured
# in codons.
#
# Remember that, as Python reads this program and sees this function
# definition, it says "Ah, next time you ask me to printCandidateGenes,
# I'll know what to do," but it doesn't do it yet.
