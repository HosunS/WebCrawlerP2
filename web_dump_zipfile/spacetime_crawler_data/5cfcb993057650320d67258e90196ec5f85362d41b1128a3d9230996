== Course Objectives ==
This two-course sequence is intended to be the "grand finale" for Data Science majors.
Its goal is to tie together many of the topics that are independently covered in the first 3+ years of Data Science requirements and electives; it also aims to fill in in some of the potential gaps required to solve an end-to-end problem. 
In addition to a brief few review of some of the required skills, the course will cover problem definition and analysis, data representation, algorithm selection, solution validation, and results presentation.
Students will do projects, probably in small teams, while lecture periods will cover analysis alternatives, project planning, and data analysis issues.
The first quarter will emphasize tools and techniques, approach selection, project planning, and experimental design.
The second quarter will focus on project execution, data analysis, and presentation of results.
Project planning and execution will include the setting of weekly or bi-weekly milestones as well as weekly progress tracking and reporting.

== Prerequisites ==
Senior standing and completion of the following courses: STATS 68, STATS 111, IN4MATX 43, COMPSCI 122A, COMPSCI 161, COMPSCI 178.

=== Academic Honesty Policy ===
Students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!
