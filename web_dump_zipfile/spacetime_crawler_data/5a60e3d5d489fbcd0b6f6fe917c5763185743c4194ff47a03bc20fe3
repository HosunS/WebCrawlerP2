#
# Given a DNA sequence, find out if there is a gap.
#
# The way we would solve this problem on paper is to scan the sequence
# from left to right until we found a gap.  As soon as we found a gap,
# we would immediately stop and say, "Yes, there is a gap!"  If you got
# all the way to the end of the sequence without finding a gap, then
# you would conclude, "No, there is no gap."
#
# So, why not have our program do the same?

dnaSequence = "atcgatgagagctagcgata"

for c in dnaSequence:
    if c == '-':
        break

if c == '-':
    print "There is a gap in the sequence."
else:
    print "There is no gap in the sequence."

# Here's the meaning of this program:
#
# * First, the DNA sequence is set.  (Next week, we'll start having our
#   programs get their DNA sequences from other places: the user of the
#   program, or a file.)
#
# * For each character in the DNA sequence:
#     - If the character is a dash, stop looping through the characters
#       immediately.  (That's what the "break" does.)
#     - If it's not, move on to the next one.
#
# * When you get through with the loop, there's one of two reasons you
#   did: (1) a dash was found, or (2) we ran out of characters.  We can
#   figure out which thing happened by looking at c: if it's a dash, we
#   got out of the loop because we found a dash, otherwise we got out
#   of the loop because we ran out of characters.
