S or U (Satisfactory of Unsatisfactory) rather than a letter grade.  
Such a grade will be assigned only if you request it and 
I approve your request.

in a previous offering.
If you think you might want be assigned an S/U grade instead of a letter
grade, you should talk to me.

<LI> <b>Note on Email:</b> 
If you send me email about the course, please do the following
<OL>
<LI>
Please include the string "CompSci 260:" at the start of the subject line 
(to ensure that it gets
past my spam filter). 
<LI>
Please include your name and student number in the message.
<LI>
If you are not writing me from your official UCI email address, please
cc your official UCI email address.
</OL>
(The reason for the first request is self-explanatory.  The second and the
third are because I occasionally get email from non-UCI-students asking for
help on problems, and I want to weed them out.)

<LI><b>Course announcements</b> will be sent via email to all students enrolled
in the class.
