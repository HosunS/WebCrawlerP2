Hi,

There is a definite chance that they are one and the same, or named after the 
same. Can you tell me more about your grandfather's heritage? Where and when 
he was born? his parent's names? Where he lived? etc? 

I will be away now for 2 weeks, so I will look for your response when I return.

Thanks for taking the time to contact me!

DEAR MOISHE:

As i was analyzing the "SPIRA" family tree, i was delighted to find the family 
of reb YAAKOV URI,you mentioned "ELYUKIM" as one of r' yaakov's sons,but you 
had no additional information on him.

Being that i had a great-grandfather wite the name of r' ELYUKIM UHR, which 
was a grandchild of r' TZVI ELIMEILICH SPIRA, the famous "bnei yisoscher", we 
might even be talking about the very same person!   I'll be more then glad to 
share his history with you, and i would be very appreciative if you could halp 
me with some information in return.

ELYUKIM URI was born between the years of 1835-1845, to his father ? (whose 
information i'm missing), in the galicia part of poland, there he grew up, 
married his first wife with whom he raised a family, unfortunately, his wife 
passed away at early stage, and he remarried HINDA the daughter of r' ISSAC 
PREISS from "KOSICE" .{i don't remember if she was a widow or still a girl} 
when r' ELYUKIM remarried he moved to KOSICE, which was near or a part of 
HUNGARY and because of that he changed his surename from "URI" to "UHR", 
which means an emperor in hungarian language, he had three children with his 
wife HINDA {one of them was my g.g.mother named RACHEL who married my 
g.g.father r' PINCHAS TZVI RUBIN, they had about 9-10 children & they both 
where killed in the gas chambers in auchswitz by nazi germeny}, reb ELYUKIM 
passed away at the age of about "80" between the years of 1915-1925 and was 
buried in kosice. His wife passed away on DEC.10 1937 and she to was buried 
in kosice. In fact I even have a photograph of her tomestone where she is 
mentioed as" wife of famous rabbi elyukim uhr".

Also, while doing research, I once came across of the jewish cemetery listing 
in KOSICE, among the many people buried there,was:UHR ILIAS, AUGUST 3 1919, 
AGE 80, It was my assumption that it may have been ELYUKIM UHR.{here is the 
address take a look at it:}

http://www.kosice.sk/history/zidovsky/jew_ux.htm 

Hastly, I would like to know how you obtained the information that ELYUKIM was 
a son of r' YAAKOV, and if you would think it is the same ELYUKIM I'm talking 
about

                                                            GOOD LUCK!

                                                            sincerely yours

                                                            JOEL RUBIN

Dear Joel,

Thanks for your extensive information. Can you elaborate some more? I feel 
there is a definite connection here. 

The Elyakim name comes from a sefer "Bais Avrohm". What is your mailing 
address, so I can send you a copy?

Can you tell me how many children Elaykim had with his first wife? What 
was her name? The children's names? 

What were the names of Hinda's other two children? What is your exact 
lineage from Rachel?

Have you seen the page at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/uri.htm

Should I write to the Kosice archives and request the death record of 
Ilias Uhr?
