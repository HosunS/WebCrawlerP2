When this group began one of its first realizations was that versioning and distributed authorship across the Internet meant loss of access to the file system. This is why Copy, Move, and Rename have appeared in the current version of the groupï¿½s requirements.
<BR></UL><UL>
Access control is just as fundamental to a file system and to our needs as any of the previously mentioned operations. Access control answers questions such as: Who may see this URL? Who may check it out? Who may lock it? Without this control it becomes impossible to provide versioning or distributed authorship outside of intranets where the file system is readily available.
</UL><UL>
This having been said this group is not the proper forum to address these issues. However I do suggest, much as with the issue of backwards compatibility, that a sub-group be formed to deal with this facility.</UL> </P>
