// Code Example: A Simple Socket Client and Server
//
// Written by Alex Thornton for Informatics 45 Spring 2010
// Minor revisions by Norman Jacobson for ICS 45J Spring 2012 

// This is client program. It first asks the user to
// specify the address and port of the server that it 
// should connect to. It then establishes a connection 
// and begins participating in our simple protocol.  Each 
// time it needs to send a message, it asks the user to
// specify that message.
//
// This program makes no realistic attempt to handle any 
// of the problems that might arise while it runs (for 
// example, what to do if a connection cannot be made). It 
// just lets any input/output exception be thrown, which will 
// cause the program to throw and exception and exit. This is 
// obviously not the way to write a robust program, but it 
// does let us provide a simple demonstration of using sockets
// without obscuring the basics with all the "clutter" needed
// for a program that would actually be used. (And, yes, there
// are other ways to do this, using different methods from the
// Socket and other, related libraries.)

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import java.util.Scanner;


public class ChatClient
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	throws IOException
	{
		// We'll need a scanner so that we can read input from the
		// keyboard, which Java knows as System.in:
		Scanner consoleIn = new Scanner(System.in);

		// WAsk the user to specify the address and port that this
		// client should connect to; notice we assume the user
		// makes no typing mistakes--again, unrealistic for a 
		// "real" program
		System.out.print("Address: ");
		String address = consoleIn.nextLine();
		
		System.out.print("Port: ");
		int port = Integer.parseInt(consoleIn.nextLine());

		System.out.println("Connecting");

		// When you create a Socket object and specify its address (a string)
		// and port (an integer), it immediately attempts to establish a
		// connection to that location.  Note that this operation, as well as
		// any other that uses the socket, may block indefinitely -- your
		// program has no control over how long it will take to establish
		// the connection, and it will just sit and wait until the connection
		// is made.  (It may eventually give up -- or "time out," as it's more
		// commonly called.  But it may be a while.)  This can be a problem,
		// especially for programs with a graphical user interface that needs
		// to remain responsive.  There are ways to handle this problem, but
		// again, to keep this example simple, we don't handle here.
		Socket socket = new Socket(address, port);
		System.out.println("Connected to port " + port + " at " + address);

		// We're connected!  That means we now have an "input stream",
		// where data from the other machine will arrive, and an "output
		// stream", where we'll put data that we want to be sent to the
		// other machine.
		//
		// To make the streams simpler to use, since our protocol is all
		// based on text, we'll wrap them with objects that let us
		// handle text input and output simply.  Note that these are the
		// same kinds of objects (Scanners and PrintWriters) that you can
		// use to simplify reading and writing text to and from files:  
		// A nice thing about Scanners and PrintWriters is that they
		// don't care where they get their input or where they write their
		// output; this makes them flexible enough to use in many scenarios,
		// including this one.
		//
		// One important little detail here: When we create the PrintWriter,
		// we give it two parameters: the stream (which it will "wrap,"
		// by sending any data to it when it's written) and a boolean
		// "true" value.  The second parameter is called "autoFlush"
		// and "true" turns it on. When data is written to a PrintWriter
		// it is ordinarily "buffered," which means that it's held in
		// memory until there's a whole bunch of it; only then is it
		// written out to the target (say, a file). This is wise, because
		// writing output is slow. Unfortunately, this will play havoc
		// with our protocol, because we want to be absolutely sure that
		// any data we place into the PrintWriter is immediately placed
		// into the socket's output stream, so that it will immediately
		// be sent to the server. (This is important: remember that the
		// server is sitting and waiting -- indefinitely! -- for our data
		// to show up.)
		Scanner socketIn = new Scanner(socket.getInputStream());
		PrintWriter socketOut = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
		
		System.out.println("Input and output streams established");

		// Each time through the loop, we're reading a message from the console
		// and sending it to the server, then reading the response from the
		// socket and printing it to the console.  The ends when one side
		// sends an empty message or response, in which case we send an
		// empty string to the other side (to make sure that it also knows
		// to stop) and then bail out of this loop.
		
		boolean done = false;
		do
		{
			// Ask for a message; we're done if none is given
			System.out.print("Message: ");

			String message = consoleIn.nextLine();
			
			if (message.length() == 0)
			{
				System.out.println("Ending conversation");
				socketOut.println("");
				done = true;
			}
			
			if (!done)
			{
				// THere was a message; send it to the server
				socketOut.println(message);

				// At this point, the program will pause indefinitely, waiting for
				// the response to arrive from the server.

				String response = socketIn.nextLine();
			
				// We got a response. If it's non-empty, go back
				// and get another message; if it is empty, we're done
				if (response.length() != 0)
					System.out.println("Response: " + response);
				else
				{
					System.out.println("Server ended conversation");
					done = true;
				}
			}
		} while (!done);
		
		System.out.println("Closing connection");

		// It's important that we close the socket when we're done with it.
		socket.close();
