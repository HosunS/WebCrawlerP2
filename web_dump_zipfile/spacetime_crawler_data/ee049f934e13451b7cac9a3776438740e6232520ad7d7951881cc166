    <h3 id="item04">Meeting at TPAC2011</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I have asked for a meeting
    slot; I've pencilled us in for a f2f meeting during TPAC 2011,
    the first week of November in Santa Clara, CA, US.<br />
    ... Anyone know for sure their plans?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Paul:</cite> I expect to be there.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>ht</cite>&gt; I hope to be, yes</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> So do I.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Jim:</cite> Probably not.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Vojtech:</cite> If there's work to do,
    then I can arrange something.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Ok, the onus is on me to
    get an agenda together int ime for you to make that
    decision.</p>

    <h3 id="item05">Maps in XPath 3.0?</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Do we have an opinion about
    maps?</p>

    <p class='phone'>Henry attempts to summarize the state of
    maps.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>jfuller</cite>&gt; I like maps</p>

    <p class='phone'>Norm attempts as well.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> In XProc 1.0, we only have
    strings and only XML data flows between steps so it's not clear
    how we would use them.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Vojtech:</cite> I had to implement maps
    as extension steps for some internal use cases.<br />
    ... I keep them as a global map because they were done as
    steps.<br />
    ... I think it would be good to have them, but it can be solved
    in an implementation-dependent way.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I think if there is an
    XProc 2.0, then one of the things we might do is relax the
    restriction on variables. At that point, we probably want
    maps.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> I've done some
    explorations in this space and looked into the most efficient
    implementation. I think that's a good reason to have maps as a
    first class data structure.<br />
    ... If I, as a user, have a map with 10000 elements, I
    shouldn't have to worry about the most efficient way to update
    it. That's the implementation's job.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Some discussion of mutability. Maps aren't
    mutable.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>ht</cite>&gt; I endorse John Snelson's
    observation wrt copying</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> It sounds like we'd support
    the idea of maps, but we can't use them in 1.0.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>ht</cite>&gt; +1</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Anyone object to me telling
    the XSLT and XQuery WGs that?</p>

    <p class='phone'>No objections heard.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Jim:</cite> XML serialization?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Yes, that's possible.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Jim:</cite> What about QNames?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> There's a literal syntax
    for those too.</p>

    <h3 id="item06">Last call of XML processor profiles</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Thank you Henry for doing
    all the heavy lifting in getting that spec out.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> No problem, sorry it took
    so long.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> No worries.</p>

    <h3 id="item07">Recommended processor profile in the
    browser</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> I've been looking at the
    browser XML processor, specifically in WebKit.<br />
    ... The browsers don't like to go fetch external resources
    unless they absolutely have to.<br />
    ... In the case of HTML, you have to go get scripts and
    things.<br />
    ... But in the case of XML, that's not necessarily the case. In
    WebKit, they've just turned off processing external
    entities.<br />
    ... If we don't do that, then we can't do the Recommended
    profile. So which profile can I follow?<br />
    ... Then I realized that I lose XInclude and that's something
    that I think would be useful to have in the browser.<br />
    ... So I feel like I don't have a profile that fits a web
    browser where you don't go get external definitions but you
    would like XInclude.<br />
    ... Lots of languages these days aren't defined in terms of
    DTDs, so maybe it's a mistake to have them.<br />
    ... I looked a little bit at MathML, because they need entities
    and that's the main reason for the external subset. MathML 3
    seems to just say "just use Unicode".<br />
    ... So I have a feeling we have a mismatch.<br />
    ... Henry, did you have specific things in mind besides
    math?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> I don't want to lose it as
    a profile, because it continues to be the profile I want. I
    wish the browsers would implement it.<br />
    ... When I develop with standard DTDs, I can't just hand the
    result to the browser, it's a real pain.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> I hear what you're
    saying.<br />
    ... If you use DTDs, you don't get the behavior you want. The
    real problem is how HTML is processed which doesn't need DTD
    processing.<br />
    ... XHTML is an XML language, and they don't want to go get
    external declarations in that case.<br />
    ... It turns out to be really complicated to get external
    declarations for XML but not for XHTML. So people just say they
    don't want to deal with DTDs.<br />
    ... I'm not sure what to say there.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Neither am I.<br />
    ... I not also John Cowan's comments that recently came in. He
    doesn't like the last one either.<br />
    ... He doesn't like the names full stop.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> If all we had to do was
    change the names, that'd be lovely.<br />
    ... I don't know what to do about the browser case.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Going back to way back to
    one (but not the only) item that's near to the director's heart
    is the question of what infoset the author is committed
    to.<br />
    ... And my feeling is that it's pretty clear that its the last
    one and only the last one. Crucially, if i have a DTD in the
    document and in the external subset I define parity as a
    general entity who's value is "not" and I write "I do
    &amp;parity;(insert inflamatory reference)" in a document, to
    what is the author committed?<br />
    ... Clearly it's not the version of the document that doesn't
    have the value for the entity.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Yeah. I think that's a
    pretty compelling argument for not "recommending" anything that
    doesn't do the external subset.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> Maybe we need to add
    something to deal with the standalone declaration.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Bad idea. No one
    understands it, no one uses it correctly.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I expect Michael
    Sperberg-McQueen to file a comment about that, based on
    conversations we had in Prague.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> It does answer the question
    from the author's perspective.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> It's interesting, could we
    "recommend" only using documents that have standalone=yes.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> On the web, we could. I
    don't know if I want to.<br />
    ... The other side of that is the XML promise, that all XML
    processors can process all well-formed documents. Surely if we
    recommend standalone=yes, browsers should reject documents that
    assert standalone=no</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> So where are we?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> It's a real issue because
    external subsets become a bottleneck.<br />
    ... We should have good, solid answers to questions about how
    you deal with the questions.<br />
    ... And if I fall back from the recommended profile then I lose
    XInclude which I don't want to lose.<br />
    ... I wonder why we don't have one inbetween?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Basically because we
    thought five was too many.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I'm inclined to give this a
    week.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Can I address a completely
    different issue wrt the spec?<br />
    ... To call people's attention to the fact that I restructured
    things a bit to try to make the relationships clearer.<br />
    ... This was in direct response to a comment from Liam just as
    we were going out the door.<br />
    ... If anyone has any problems or spots any errors, it would be
    helpful to hear about that.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I like the fact they're
    links now.</p>

    <h3 id="item08">Any other business?</h3>

    <p class='phone'>None heard.</p>
