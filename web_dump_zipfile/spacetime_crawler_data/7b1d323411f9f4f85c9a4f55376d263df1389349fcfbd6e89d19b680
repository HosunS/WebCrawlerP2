<h1 style="text-align: center;">COGS Lab Rules</h1>
As a student in a course that is using the COGS Lab, you will have
unrestricted access to the lab for the Winter quarter.&nbsp; It is
important that the rules listed below are followed.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>No food or drink of any kind, including bottled water, is permitted in the COGS Lab.</li>
  <li>When you leave the COGS Lab, make sure that your computer is
turned off, that the room is neat, and that the door closes behind you.</li>
  <li>After 6:00pm and before 8:00am, and always during weekends, use
your access code to enter the COGS Lab, even if the door is propped
open.&nbsp; After hours, do not allow anyone into the lab who does not
have an access code.&nbsp; If someone entering does have an access
code, he or she should use it.&nbsp; Do not give your access code to
anyone else.</li>
  <li>Course labs and discussions are scheduled at certain times during
the week; you should not plan to use the COGS lab during those times
unless it is your scheduled lab period.</li>
  <li>Permission to use the COGS Lab lasts through the end of the
quarter; your access code will stop working on Friday of Finals
week.&nbsp; Permission may be revoked at any time.</li>
</ol>
