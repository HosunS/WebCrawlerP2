<h2>ICS 162 - Final Exam Study Questions
<br>
</h2>

</center>

<p> The final exam
is comprehensive.  Thus, the previous study
questions for 
<a href="midterm1.html">Midterm 1</a> and
<a href="midterm2.html">Midterm 2</a> also apply to the final exam.

<p>
In addition to the readings and previous homeworks, listed on the 
<a href="index.html">CS 162 Homework page</a>,
and the previous study questions,
solving the following questions will provide a good preparation
for the final exam.

<ol>
<li> Problem 5.3 from Sipser. </li>
<li> Problem 5.6 from Sipser. </li>
<li> Problem 5.7 from Sipser. </li>
<li> Problem 5.10 from Sipser. </li>
<li> Problem 5.11 from Sipser. </li>
<li> Exercise 7.5 in Sipser               </li>
<li> Exercise 7.6 in Sipser               </li>
<li> Exercise 7.7 in Sipser               </li>
<li> Exercise 7.12 in Sipser               </li>
<li> Exercise 7.23 in Sipser               </li>
<li>
Define SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM as the problem that takes a graph, G, and
another graph, H, and determines if H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G. That
is, the problem is to determine whether there is a one-to-one mapping, f, of the
vertices in H to a subset of the vertices in G such that, if (v,w) is an edge in
H, then (f(v), f(w)) is an edge in G. Show that SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM is
NP-complete.
<li>
Define INDEPENDENT-SET as the problem that takes a graph G and an integer k
and asks whether G contains an independent set of vertices of size k. That is, G
contains a set I of vertices of size k such that, for any v and w in I, there is no
edge (v,w) in G. Show that INDEPENDENT-SET is NP-complete.
<li>
Define HYPER-COMMUNITY to be the problem that takes a collection of n web
pages and an integer k, and determines if there are k web pages that all contain
hyperlinks to each other. Show that HYPER-COMMUNITY is NP-complete.
<li> Exercise 8.4 in Sipser               </li>
