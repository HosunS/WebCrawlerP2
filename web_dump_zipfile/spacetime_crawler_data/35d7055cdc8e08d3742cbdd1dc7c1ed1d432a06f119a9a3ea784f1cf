<dt>Textbook</dt>
<ul>
<li>Linear Algebra and its Applications, 5th edition, by David
  Lay</li>
</ul>

<dt>Polices </dt>
<ul>
<li>Grading criteria:
<ul>
<li>Homework (25%)</li>
<li>Lab assignments (15%)</li>
<li>Two quizzes (30%)</li>
<li>Final (30%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Homework: You may discuss each assignment with others, but are
  required to code and write up each assignment independently.</li>
<li>Late homework policy: If you get a note from the Student's Office
  (personal problems) or infirmary (medical problems) requesting a
  postponement, it will be honored. Otherwise, late homework will not
  be accepted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lab: There are four lab assignments due on days and times as given
  above. All of the labs will require some programming in
  Matlab. There are many online tutorials available to you if you
  decide you need some help in addition to what is provided in the
  assignment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Lab assignments will consist of performing some Matlab
  instructions as well as written work.  
<!--
You will hand in hard copy (prinout) of your code and written work. 
The results of all the
  questions should be copied into a pdf file. You will hand in both
  the pdf file and a file containing all commands you run for each
  lab.-->  
</li>
<li>Matlab is installed in many machines in the lab. In addition to
  scheduled lab time for this class, you can drop in on any of the
  following labs to have access to a computer with Matlab. If the room
  is being used by an instructor as part of their schedule lab time,
  you can ask them if you can use one of the computers during their
  class.
<ul>
<li>ICS 365. Lab hours are posted <a class="external text"
				     href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Elab/lab_schedule/index.php">here</a>. Matlab
				     is installed in only some of the
				     machines. Ask the lab attendant
				     if you need help finding
				     one.</li>
<li>MSTB 210 Lab hours are posted <a class="external text"
				     href="http://www.oit.uci.edu/computing/labs/instructional.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>SBSG 240 Lab hours are posted <a class="external text"
				     href="http://www.oit.uci.edu/computing/labs/instructional.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Final Exam: No make-up for missed final will be entertained unless
  there is a documented evidence of medical emergency. Make-up exams
  carry less weightage than the one posted on this webpage. If you
  miss the final exam for any other reason, you will receive a zero on
  the exam.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above work load and point distribution, 1% is
  given to the students who submit the final course evaluation. Though
  the instruction staff cannot see the evaluation until the grades the
  submitted, they can see the names of the students who have submitted
  the evaluation, in order for them to give this additional
  point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Above point distribution may be changed at the discretion of the
  instructor without prior notice or discussion, typically in favor of
  students.</li>
</ul>


<dt>Obtaining
    Assistance </dt>
<ul>
<li>Please use Piazza for questions related to homework, lab, exams
  and teaching material. For private questions, send email with your
  questions to all the teaching staff for quicker response. Subject
  line should start with the string `ICS 6N`. The message should
  contain your name and student number.</li>
<li>You are responsible for anything communicated in class by the
  instructor, including class announcements. If you have to miss
  lecture for any reason, please ask one of your classmates to fill
  you in on what you missed. You can use the message board to ask
  general questions that your classmates can answer.</li>
<li>Lab time is an important time to get questions answered about
  homework problems and labs. Some lab time will be spent walking you
  through features of Matlab that you will need for your lab
  assignments. Lab time is the best time for troubleshooting issues
  that come up with Matlab or lab assignments.</li>
<li>Questions about grading should be asked to the person who graded
  your paper during his/her office hours or by appointment.</li>
</ul>

<dt>Academic
    Honesty </dt>
<p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established
  an academic honesty policy. Read it.</p>
<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties
  described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to
  an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop
  the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single
  documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from
  switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors,
  joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing
  major with honors.</p>

<dt>Guidelines to avoid plagiarism</dt>
<p>Do not look at another person's homework. Instead you should prefer
  to discuss the problem in plain English. This helps you to
  communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your
  problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior
  different from what you expect.</p>
<p>Do not write down the solution in your notes. It is perfectly fine
  (and encouraged) to collaborate on work. Working in a group is a
  rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any
  professional career. The collaboration can include drawing diagrams
  and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard. However, you should
  avoid writing the solution in your notes. It is very useful to
  rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you
  solve it again on your own.</p>

<dt>We expect
    that </dt>
<p>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among
  yourselves. Making sure that others follow these guidelines will
  help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>
<p>Your work honestly represents your efforts. The entire purpose of
  obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of
  skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not
  perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the
  education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for
  skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if
  you do not practice now by doing your own work.</p>
