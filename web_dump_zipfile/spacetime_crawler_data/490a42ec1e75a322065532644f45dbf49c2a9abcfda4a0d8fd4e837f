<h6> Prerequisites for taking this class </h6>
Knowledge of basic concepts in probability, multivariate calculus, and linear algebra are required for this course. 
Note in particular that a good understanding of basic concepts in probability is important for this class.  
</p>  

<p>
<h6> Course Goals </h6>
Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of probabilistic approaches to machine learning. 
Probabilistic learning is a key component in many areas within modern computer science, 
including artificial intelligence, data mining, speech recognition, computer vision, bioinformatics, and so forth. 
The course will provide a tutorial introduction to the basic principles of probabilistic modeling and then 
demonstrate the application of these principles to the analysis, development, and practical 
use of machine learning algorithms.  Topics covered will include probabilistic modeling, 
defining likelihoods, parameter estimation using likelihood and Bayesian techniques, 
probabilistic approaches to classification, clustering, and regression, and related topics 
such as model selection and bias/variance tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
<h6> Grading Policy </h6>
Final grades will be based on a combination of homework assignments and exams: 30% homeworks, 30% midterm, and 40% final. 
Your lowest scoring homework will be dropped and not included in your score. No credit for late homeworks.  
</p>

<p>
<h6> Academic Integrity </h6>
Students are expected to be read and be familiar with the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/courses/academic_integrity">Academic
Integrity Policy</a> for this class. 
Failure to adhere to this policy can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class.  
</p>
