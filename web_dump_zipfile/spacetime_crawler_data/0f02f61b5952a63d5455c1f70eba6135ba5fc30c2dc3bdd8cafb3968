<p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/eppstein/">Published in 2018 by
Cambridge University Press</a>, this book surveys many famous problems
in the geometry of finite point sets in the plane, unifying them under
the framework of properties that depend only on how triples of points
are oriented and that behave monotonically as points are removed, and
covering both mathematical and computational aspects of the subject. It
is aimed at a range of readers from advanced undergraduates in
mathematics and computer science to research professionals.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/forbidden-configurations-in-discrete-geometry">Darren
Glass, <em>MAA Reviews</em>, July 2018</a>: ‚ÄúThere is a lot to like about
this book, as Eppstein does a good job of introducing the material to
his readers. I will note that I think many mathematicians will find
certain aspects of Eppstein‚Äôs writing style and notational conventions
to be different from what we are used to, and while I found his choice
of topics interesting I know that the book made me think of many more
questions that he did not address. A reader who sticks with Eppstein
will learn a lot about this exciting area that lies on the border of
mathematics and computer science.‚Äù</li>

  <li>
    <p>Open Problem 3.14 (the maximum number of halving partitions) should have
been credited to the paper that introduced this problem:</p>

    <p class="ref">Erd≈ës, Paul, Lov√°sz, L√°szl√≥; Simmons, A., and Straus, Ernst
G. 1973. <a href="https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1973-07.pdf">Dissection graphs of planar point
sets</a>. Pages 139‚Äì149 of: <em>A
survey of combinatorial theory (Proc. Internat. Sympos., Colorado State
Univ., Fort Collins, Colo., 1971)</em>. Amsterdam: North-Holland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 6.5 (property testing) should have credited the following paper, where the model of property testing used here originates:</p>

    <p class="ref">Czumaj, Artur, Sohler, Christian, and Ziegler, Martin.
2000. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45253-2_15">Property testing in computational
geometry</a>. Pages 155‚Äì166
of: <em>8th European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2000)</em>. Lecture Notes
in Computer Science, vol. 1879, Berlin: Springer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theorem 7.3 states that, under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time
hypothesis</a>,
no algorithm with running time $n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ can test whether a
configuration of size $k$ is a subconfiguration of an input of size $n$.
The proof uses convex embedding to reduce from finding cliques in
graphs. The conclusion can be strengthened to running time $n^{o(k/\log
k)}$ using a similar reduction from labeled subgraph isomorphism (this
problem is described e.g. in Eppstein and Lokshtanov 2018).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open problem 7.6 (the existence of a finite set of obstacles such that
finding a $k$-point set avoiding the obstacles is not fixed-parameter
tractable) has been solved by the following paper:</p>

    <p class="ref">Eppstein, David, and Lokshtanov, Daniel. 2018. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02162">The
parameterized complexity of finding point sets with hereditary
properties</a>. Pages 11:1‚Äì11:14 of:
<em>13th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation
(IPEC 2018)</em>. Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,
Dagstuhl: Leibniz-Zentrum f√ºr Informatik, to appear.</p>

    <p>It shows that under standard complexity-theoretic
assumptions there is no FPT algorithm for this general problem: for the
three obstacles below, this problem is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard,
and no algorithm can solve the problem in time $n^{o(k/\log k)}$ unless the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>
fails.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="three-obstacles.svg" alt="Three obstacles for a hard property" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theorem 9.3 states in part that finding the largest general-position
subset is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard and $\mathsf{APX}$-hard, and Theorem 9.5 states that it is
fixed-parameter tractable in the size of the subset. The same results
are proven in:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theorem 9.13 of Payne and Wood implies that every $n$-point set has
a subset of size $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ that is either collinear
or in general position. A new result of Hajnal and Szemer√©di
improves this to $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log\log n/\log n})$:</p>

    <p class="ref">Hajnal, P√©ter, and Szemer√©di, Endre. 2018. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-57413-3_8">Two geometrical applications

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theorem 10.12 on point sets with no four in line and no general-position
subset larger than $O(n^{5/6+\epsilon})$ is credited to a 2017 preprint
by Balogh and Solymosi. Their paper has now been published. It is:</p>

    <p>Observation 11.7 gives asymptotic bounds on the largest convex polygon
in a grid, and figure 11.3 gives an example of the largest polygon
in a $5\times 5$ grid. More precise asymptotic bounds for the square grid
were given by</p>

for more on this topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open problem 11.10 (the sample size for property testing convex
position) was already answered by Czumaj, Sohler, and Ziegler (2000). The
optimal sample size is $\Theta(n^{2/3})$.</p>

    <p>One proof of this (not the one they give) is to consider any point $p$
of high Tukey depth, observe that logarithmically many samples are
enough to have high probability of enclosing $p$, and consider the
nonconvex quadruples of points formed by $p$ and three given points. If
linearly many quadruples are disjoint (except for $p$) then one is
likely to be found by the remaining sample points; otherwise, deleting
all of the points in a maximal disjoint family of quadruples shows that
the input is near-convex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Footnotes 6 and 7 of section 13.4 give two references for sets of seven
points in the plane, all at integer distances, with no three on a line
and no four on a circle. Many more such sets with the additional property
that all coordinates are integers (including the set with the smallest
possible diameter) were found by:</p>

    <p class="ref">Kurz, Sascha, Noll, Landon Curt, Rathbun, Randall, and Simmons,
Chuck. 2014. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2318">Constructing 7-clusters</a>.
<em>Serdica J. Comput.</em> 8(1), 47‚Äì70.</p>

    <p>Their paper provides several additional references to earlier work
on this problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Footnote 4 at the start of Section 16.3 lists three papers on linear
lower bounds for universal point sets. A new fourth paper improves
them, but the bound is still linear:</p>

    <p class="ref">Scheucher, Manfred, Schrezenmaier, Hendrik, and Steiner, Raphael. 2018.
A note on universal point sets for planar graphs. Electronic preprint
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06482">https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06482</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proof of Theorem 16.13 (universal point sets cannot be covered by
few lines) used the fact that certain graphs, the Apollonian networks,
cannot be drawn with their points on a bounded number of lines. This was
already known for a different class of planar graphs, the maximal planar
graphs of small dual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_exponent">shortness
exponent</a>. See the
following two papers:</p>
