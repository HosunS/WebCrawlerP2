<p>The 18th annual interdisciplinary conference addresses a variety of topics, including the impact of trauma and immigration on child development and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Offering a unique update for primary care and subspecialty health care professionals and others who care for children, youth, and adults with developmental disabilities and complex health care needs, the 2019 conference covers a broad spectrum of developmental disabilities across the lifespan including autism spectrum disorders, mental health, genetic screening and diagnoses, and intervention and therapeutic consideration. Focus on special education, law enforcement, and policy from a variety of specialists adds to the content. We are pleased to present cutting edge talks on new advances in vision screening, developmental effects of perinatal marijuana and substance use, sleep disorders in people with Developmental Disabilities, dermatologic disorders in Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities, atypical seizure disorders, and intriguing therapeutic techniques and research overview for autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>Presentations by our expert faculty should be of interest to pediatricians, family physicians, nurse clinicians, psychologists, and internists who are involved in the health care of individuals with developmental disabilities, as well as to those in other healthrelated disciplines including health policy, epidemiology, psychiatry, school health, social work, and case management services. While the conference is designed for health care professionals, we welcome families and individuals with developmental disabilities who wish to learn from the various represented disciplines.</p>
<p>Non-profit conference exhibitors feature resources designed to help our audience better provide care for children, youth, and adults with developmental disabilities. We look forward to welcoming you to the 18th annual Developmental Disabilities Update Conference and hope that your patients and clients with special health care needs will benefit from your participation.</p>
