<div class=title> <center> <h2>ICS 45J Fall 2012<br> Setting Up Java and
Eclipse On Your Computer</h2> </center>

<div class="section"> <p class="title">A word of warning</p>

<p>One of the advantages of programming in Java is that there are
easy--and cheap--ways to set up a working Java environment on your own
computer.  On the other hand, working in the lab has some genuine
benefits, particularly for those of you who are new to ICS. In the lab,
your development environment will be the same as the production
environment, so you won't have to worry about whether what you wrote "at
home" will work "in the lab." It's also a great place to work with your
partner, and to talk over assignments with other ICS 45J students. It
also tends to be less distracting than working elsewhere.

<p>Nevertheless, we're aware that many of you will choose to do some
percentage of your work on your own machines, so, as a courtesy, we
provide below enough information to have your Windows-based or Macintosh
computer support the Eclipse development environment and Oracle's
release of Java, using freely available software.

You are free to use any development environment you like, but <i>your
resulting programs must work in the "production environment" for this
course;</i> that is, using Oracle's version of Java running under
Eclipse. So, if you are completing the assignments on your own computer,
we strongly recommend you test them on the lab computers before turning
them in.</p>

<p class="title">Windows and Mac OS X Lion and Mountain Lion
installations only</p>

<p>This document only describes how to set up Sun's Java 7 and Eclipse
Classic (Indigo)--the environment for this class--on a computer running
Windows or Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or 10.8 (Mountain Lion). To install Java
under these operating systems, see the applicable section below.</p>

<p>(If you want to run Java under a version of Mac OS X prior to Lion,
there is a version from the OpenJDK group, but it requires a fair bit of Unix and can be 
tricky to install; unless you are pretty familiar with Unix programming and package 
installation on Macs, we suggest update your O/S and install Sun's Java rather than the 
Open OS Java package.)</p>

<p>If you use Linux or Solaris, JDK 7 Update 7 can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
">Java SE Downloads</a>, the same way it can for Windows; we do not
discuss the details of installation here, but there is ample
documentation available on the web.</p>

<div class="section">

<p class="title">Setting up Java on Windows</p>


<p class="subtitle">Removing Eclipse and previous versions of Java</p>

<p>First, it's best if you delete Eclipse and uninstall all earlier
versions of Java you have installed on your machine. (Use the
"Add/Remove Programs" utility in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel to
uninstall Java; delete the <font class = "codefacesmall">eclipse</font>
folder to delete Eclipse.) Leaving old versions causes setup of Java 7
to be more complicated and problematic. Further, an old version of
Eclipse will not recognize the new version of Java without some rather
messy settings changes, whereas installing Eclipse after installing the
new Java will cause Eclipse to find and use Java 7 without any fuss.  If
you absolutely must keep older versions of Java on your machine, the
instructions below may not be sufficient to have the new version of Java
work correctly&mdash;you'll need to seek additional assistance.

<p class="subtitle">Getting started</p>

<p>What you'll need to get started is the latest  production (non-beta)
version of the Java SE 7 JDK (JDK 7) from <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
">Java SE Downloads</a>, since this is the version we use in the lab. 
Just click on the  <font class = "codefacesmall">JDK Download </font>
button in the Java SE 7u6 section of the screen, accept the
license agreement, choose the version of Java that matches your
operating system and save the downloaded <font class =
"codefacesmall">exe</font> file. For those using Windows 7 and earlier,
related OS, such as Windows Vista, 2000, and XP, choose the download for
<font class = "codefacesmall">Windows x86</font> systems. The x86
version will work even if you have a 64-bit (Itanium-based) machine.

If you would rather install the 64-bit (x64) version of Java 7 on your
64-bit machine, go ahead and download the 64-bit vesion's <font class =
"codefacesmall">exe</font>.</p>

<p>  Be sure you download the JDK and <i>not</i> the JRE!  The JDK
includes a Java compiler (<font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font>), a
Java virtual machine (<font class = "codefacesmall">java</font>), and
all of the standard Java library components &mdash; in other words,
everything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem
domains, and more than enough firepower for the assignments we'll be
giving you.  (The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, which includes
the necessary code to allow you to <i>run</i> Java programs, but not to
write and compile them.)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Installation: the easy part</p>

<p>The JDK includes an installation program, which places all of the
files into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for
you: Double-click on the <font class = "codefacesmall">exe</font> file
you downloaded; if asked, say "yes" to allowing the program to modify
your computer, and then follow the instructions on the installation
screens (it's typically best to just accept the default settings).

On 32-bit machines, the <font class = "codefacesmall">Java</font> folder
will be put inside the <font class = "codefacesmall">Program
Files</font> folder on the C: drive; that is, its path will be <font
class = "codefacesmall">C:\Program Files\Java</font>. However, if you
are installing the 64-bit version of Java, or the 32-bit version on a
64-bit machine, the path may well be different. <i>Do make a note of the
exact path used.</i> You will need it for the steps below.

<p>Once Java is installed, the installation program may bring up a
screen for you to install JavaFX. We do not use Java FX in this course,
so feel free to cancel that (part of the) installation.</p>

<p>When installation completes, you'll be taken to a web page to
register your installation; registration is optional.</p>

<p>With installation complete, you still won't be able to readily
execute <font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font> or <font class =
"codefacesmall">java</font> until you set the PATH and CLASSPATH
properly.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Setting the PATH and CLASSPATH: the (not all that)
hard part: </p>

<p>You can execute programs from a command prompt by simply typing their
names, such as <font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font> or <font class
= "codefacesmall">java</font>. And Eclipse iissues these commands behind
hte scenes when you run a program inside Eclipse. But there's a catch:
Comand prompt and Eclipse need to know where to find these programs. 
That is the job of the PATH environment variable.  Whenever a command to
execute a program is given (either by you or some running process on the
computer), Windows looks for it in the list of folders in the PATH. Each
folder in the PATH list is separated from the next by a semicolon;
<i>forgetting or misplacing semicolons or backslashes is a major cause
of the PATH not finding javac or java</i>.</p>

<p>Similarly, whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine needs
to be able to use a Java class (such as when you import a class from the
Java library), the compiler or virtual machine needs to know where to
find it.  This is the job of the CLASSPATH environment variable. 
CLASSPATH is a list of folders, separated by semicolons, in which the
Java compiler or virtual machine will look for a Java class whenever
it's trying to find one. <i>Forgetting or misplacing semicolons or
backslashes is a major cause of the CLASSPATH not finding clases your
program needs.</i></p>

<p>So, to make the JDK work, you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables on your system so that Windows will be able to
find <font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font> and <font class =
"codefacesmall">java</font>, and so that <font class =
"codefacesmall">javac</font> and <font class =
"codefacesmall">java</font> will be able to find all of the necessary
Java classes.</p>

<p>How you get to these environment variables is slightly different on
different versions of Windows.</p>

<p><i>On Windows 7 and Vista</i>, click the start orb in the lower-left
corner of the screen, move your mouse over <font class =
"codefacesmall">Computer</font>, right-click, and select <font class =
"codefacesmall">Properties</font> from the pop-up menu.  Click the <font
class = "codefacesmall">Advanced System Settings</font> link, then click
the <font class = "codefacesmall">Environment Variables...</font>
button.</p>

<p><i>On Windows XP and 2000</i>, right-click the <font class =
"codefacesmall">My Computer</font> icon on your desktop and select <font
class = "codefacesmall">Properties</font>.  Select the <font class =
"codefacesmall">Advanced</font> tab.  Click the <font class =
"codefacesmall">Environment Variables...</font> button.</p>

<p>Once you've brought up the environment variables, find the PATH
variable listed under "System variables". If Java was never previously
installed on this machine,  add  to the <i>end</i> of the PATH the path
to the Java folder that the installation program created. If you are
using a 32-bit Java, the text to add is</p>

<pre> ;C:Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_06\bin </pre>

<p>Do note the semicolon (;) that starts the text: it must be
present.</p>

If you installed Java on a 64-bit machine, you might need to change
the<font class = "codefacesmall"> \Program Files\Java</font> part of the
text above to match the path to the Java folder on your machine; for
example, if Java was installed in the <font class =
"codefacesmall">\Program Files (x86)</font> folder, the path text would
be

<pre> ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_06\bin </pre>

<p>If Java was previously installed, somewhere in the PATH there is
likely to be text very similar to the above, differing only in the text
between  <font class="codefacesmall">jdk</font>(and <font
class="codefacesmall">\bin</font>). Change that part of the path to match
the text above.</p>

<p>To check that the PATH is properly set, call up a <i>new</i> Command
Prompt window and enter <font class = "codefacesmall">javac
-version</font>.</p> If you see <font class = "codefacesmall">javac
1.7.0_06</font> or similar text, your path is properly set. If you
instead get an error message that javac cannot be found, the PATH is not
right; you'll need to go back and fix it.

<p>Now find the CLASSPATH variable.  If it doesn't exist (and it
probably won't, if you've never used your system to develop Java code),
click the <font class = "codefacesmall">New...</font> button, specifying
CLASSPATH as the name, and, for the value, the same text you used for
the PATH variable, except have it end in <font class =
"codefacesmall">lib</font> instead of <font class =
"codefacesmall">bin</font>. For example, the CLASSPATH text for a
standard 32-bit Java installation would be</p>

<pre> .;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_06\lib </pre>

<p>If the CLASSPATH does exist, which it likely will if Java was 
previously installed on this computer, change the CLASSPATH value text
to match the text you added to your PATH,  replacing <font class =
"codefacesmall">bin</font> with <font class =
"codefacesmall">lib</font>.</p>

<p>If you're using <font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font> and <font
class = "codefacesmall">java</font> from the command line, you will need
to bring up a new Command Prompt window, in order for these changes to
take effect.</p>

<p class="subtitle">That's it!</p>

<p>At this point, your Java installation is ready to go; you're now
ready to proceed to installing Eclipse.</p>

<p class="title">Setting up Eclipse on Windows</p>

<p class="subtitle">Downloading Eclipse</p>

<p>There are several different distirbutions of Eclipse available for
download at <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse.org</a>, each geared
toward users with differentneeds, such as Java programming and web
development. For our work in this course, we expect you to be using
<b>Eclipse Classic 4.2</b>.  Start by downloading it: click on the big
<font class = "codefacesmall">Download Eclipse</font> button, then find 
Eclipse Classic 4.2. If you are using Windows 7 or an earlier, related
OS such as Vista, 2000, or XP, click the <font class =
"codefacesmall">Windows 32 Bit</font> button; if you have a 64-bit
machine, you can download the 64-bit version of Classic instead. Then
click on a download site and save the downloaded ZIP file to your
computer.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Installing Eclipse</p>

<p>Eclipse is distributed as files in a Zip archive and, unlike most
software you install on Windows, has no installation program.  Instead,
you do a few things on your own.</p>

<ul> <li>Find the <font class = "codefacesmall">.zip</font> file that
you downloaded.  Extract it to <font class =
"codefacesmall">C:\eclipse</font>, or somewhere else you feel
comfortable putting it.  (On Windows 7, you can extract it by opening
the ZIP folder and draging the enclosed <font class =
"codefacesmall">Eclipse</font> folder to where you want to store
eclipse.) The extraction process is likely to take a while; a few
minutes or more is not uncommon.</li>

<li>Once you've extracted Eclipse into a folder, go into that folder. 
Find the file <font class = "codefacesmall">eclipse.exe</font> &mdash;
it may show up as <font class = "codefacesmall">eclipse</font> if you
have Windows Explorer configured to hide file extensions, but you can
recognize it because its icon will be the circular purple logo you see
at <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse.org</a>.</li> </ul>

<p>From here, your next step depends on which version of Windows you're
running.</p>

<p><i>On Windows 7</i>.  Double-click on <font class =
"codefacesmall">eclipse.exe</font> to start Eclipse.  When asked for a
workspace, use the default for now.  Once the program starts, you'll see
the Eclipse icon show up on your taskbar.  Right-click that icon and
select <font class = "codefacesmall">Pin this program to taskbar</font>,
so that you'll be able to run Eclipse any time you'd like.</p>

<p><i>On Windows 2000, XP, and Vista</i>.  Right-click on the <font
class = "codefacesmall">eclipse.exe</font> file you found, select <font
class = "codefacesmall">Create Shortcut</font> to create a shortcut to
allow you to run Eclipse.  Drag this shortcut to your desktop or Quick
Launch bar.  You can then use this shortcut to open Eclipse any time
you'd like.</p>

<p>That's it!  Eclipse is installed and ready to go.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<hr />

<p class="title">Setting up Java on Mac OS X Lion or Mountain Lion</p>

<p class="subtitle">Getting Started</p>

<p>What you'll need to get started is the latest  production (non-beta)
MAC version of the Java SE 7 JDK (JDK 7) from <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
">Java SE Downloads</a>, since this is the version we use in the lab. 
Just click on the  <font class = "codefacesmall">JDK Download </font>
button in the Java SE 7u6 section of the screen, accept the
license agreement, and click on the Mac OS download from the Java SE Development 
Kit 7u6 download list.</p>

<p>  Be sure you download the JDK and <i>not</i> the JRE!  The JDK
includes a Java compiler (<font class = "codefacesmall">javac</font>), a
Java virtual machine (<font class = "codefacesmall">java</font>), and
all of the standard Java library components &mdash; in other words,
everything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem
domains, and more than enough firepower for the assignments we'll be
giving you.  (The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, which includes
the necessary code to allow you to <i>run</i> Java programs, but not to
write and compile them.)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Installation: the easy part</p>

<p>The JDK includes an installation program, which places all of the
files into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for
you. The Mac download is a disk image (.dmg) file. Double click on it and
a pseudo-disk will appear on your disktop and 
a <font class =
"codefacesmall">JDK 7 Update 06</font> window will appear; click on the <font class =
"codefacesmall">.pkg</font> (package) icon in the window to begin installation. 
As installation 
progresses, follow the instructions on the screens. Close the update window
when installation completes. (You can also dismount the disk and put the
.dmg file in the trash.

<p class="subtitle">Checking if you have the latest version installed
and selected as default</p>

<p>The Mac will not necessarily use the new Java if a previous version
of Java was installed.  To see what version of Java is being used, open
a new Terminal window (by double-clicking on the Terminal
application&mdash;it's usually found in the Utilities folder inside the
Applications folder), then type the following command:</p>

<pre> java -version </pre>

<p>If you have the latest version of Java installed, you should see
lines of text, with the first line being</p>

<pre> java version "1.7.0_06" </pre>

<p>If you see that the version number starts with "1.7.0," you're in
business!  Your machine is ready to go.</p>

<p>If you see a version number that starts with something other than
"1.7" (like "1.6" or "1.5"), you'll need to continue following these
instructions.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Checking what version of Java is the default on your
machine</p>

<p>Mac OS X is perfectly happy to let different versions of Java coexist
on your machine; installing a newer version of Java doesn't remove any
earlier versions and doesn't even make the newer version the default
Java on your machine.  So, the next step is to make Java 1.7 the default
version of Java.</p>

<p>Launch <font class = "codefacesmall">Applications</font>, then select
<font class = "codefacesmall">Utilities</font>, then <font class = "codefacesmall">Java
Preferences</font>.  Click on the <font class =
"codefacesmall">General</font> tab, if it's not already selected.  In
the Java Application Runtime Settings box, see if Java SE 7 (64 bit) is
in the list; if so, drag it to the top of the list, making sure that it
is the first item.  <font class = "codefacesmall">Close</font> the
dialog box.</p>

<p>If Java SE 7 (64 bit) is not in the list at all, you'll need to
download and install the latest version of Java for your OS, as
discussed above, then make it the default version (if it is not already)
as discussed in this section.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<hr />

<p class="title">Setting up Eclipse on Mac OS X</p>

<p class="subtitle">Determining which version of Eclipse is right for
you</p>

<p>There are two separate downloads of Eclipse Classic 4.2 for Mac OS X
on the main download page, <font class = "codefacesmall">Mac OS X 32
Bit</font> and <font class = "codefacesmall">Mac OX X 64 Bit</font>. 
You want the latter version: if you are running Lion or Mountain Lion,
your Mac must be a 64-bit machine. (The 32-bit version of Eclipse is for
Macs on the order of ten or more years old. One could not run Java on
such a machine, but Eclipse supports many languages, some of which have
32-bit versions.)

<p class="subtitle">Installing Eclipse on Mac OS X</p>

<p>To install Eclipse Classic 4.2:</p>

<ul> <li>Go to <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/
downloads/</a>.</li>

<li>Look for the Eclipse Classic 4.2 entry; click on <font class =
"codefacesmall">Mac OS X 64 Bit</font>.</li>

<li>Click on the main or a mirror download site.  Choose <font class =
"codefacesmall">Save File</font> in the dialog box that appears and
click <font class = "codefacesmall">OK</font>.</li> <li>The file will
download &mdash; this may take a few minutes.</li>

<li>Double-click on the resulting .gz file to unzip and untar it. (A
"tar" is kind of compressed file).  The result will be a folder called
"eclipse".  This, too, can take a few to several minutes.</li> <li>Open
the"<font class = "codefacesmall">Eeclipse</font> folder and double-click
on the Eclipse application package.  After a minute or two, 
a dialog will
ask you to select a workspace, at which time you'll be ready to use
Eclipse. Note that, as Eclipse runs, there is a terminal window or two open; that's ok. When
you exit Eclipse, those windows will also close (and Terminal will exit).</li> </ul>
