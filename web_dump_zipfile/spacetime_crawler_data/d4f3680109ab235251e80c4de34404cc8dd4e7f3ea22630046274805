Circle Packings and Quadtrees</H1>

A <I>circle packing</I> is a collection of non-overlapping circles in
the plane, of varying sizes, pushed closely together so that every
region not covered by circles forms a triangle with exactly three
circles on its boundary.  These packings are useful in a number of applications
including
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-cpack.html">mesh
generation</A> and conformal mapping.

<P>One drawback of circle packings, though, is that they seem to be very
rigid: it is hard to change a small portion of a circle packing while
leaving the rest of it alone.  This is in contrast to some other
geometric structures such as <I>quadtrees</I>, which are formed by
repeatedly subdividing squares into quarters:

An advantage of the way quadtrees are constructed is that we can vary
the local density: in some regions we can have very small squares, while
other regions can be covered by very large squares.  This is even
possible while allowing relatively smooth gradations between adjacent squares
(for instance only allowing a square to be adjacent to others between
half and twice its size).
<P>
What I would like to discover is a similarly flexible structure for
circle packings.  Is there a way of constructing circle packings
such that (1) each circle is tangent only to others within a constant
factor of its size, and (2) if are given a sufficiently smoothly varying
"local density function" f(x,y), the circle containing a point (x,y) has size
proportional to f(x,y)?
<P>
It is possible to define circle packings that vary smoothly in one direction:

<P>
So e.g. if f(x,y) depends only on y, but not on x, the problem can be solved.
What about more general local density functions?
<P>
While mathematicians have studied circle packings for some time,
they have not been paid much attention by computational geometry,
and one can also ask many other interesting questions about them.
For instance, if we are given a finite collection of circles,
how quickly can we determine whether they can be extended to a circle packing?
Is this question even decidable?

<P>See my web essay "<A HREF="/~eppstein/junkyard/tangencies/">Tangencies</A>"
for some basic techniques of constructing certain patterns of circle
tangencies, that may be helpful in solving these problems.
