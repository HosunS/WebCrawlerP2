Shuffling Data into Cloud Oblivion

<b>Abstract:</b>
A shuffle is an algorithm for rearranging an array to achieve a random
permutation of its elements. Early shuffle methods were motivated by the
problem of shuffling a deck of cards. An oblivious shuffle is a distributed
shuffle executed by a client who permutes an array of encrypted data items
stored at a server in such a way that the server cannot determine the output
permutation with probability better than a random guess. Several private cloud
storage solutions that obfuscate the access pattern to the data use an
oblivious shuffle as a fundamental building block. We present the Melbourne
Shuffle, a simple and efficient oblivious shuffle that allows a client with
O(‚àön) memory to obliviously shuffle  an array of size n stored at a server by
exchanging O(‚àön) messages of size O(‚àön). The Melbourne Shuffle is the first
provably secure oblivious shuffle that is not based on sorting.

This talk is based on the paper ‚ÄúThe Melbourne Shuffle: Improving Oblivious
Storage in the Cloud‚Äù by Olga Ohrimenko, Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia
and Eli Upfal, International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming
(ICALP), 2014 (to appear).
