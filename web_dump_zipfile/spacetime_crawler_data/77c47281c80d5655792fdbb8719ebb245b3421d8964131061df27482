<H1>Introduction:</H1><BR>

I propose to write a research paper on the topic of Orthodox
Christianity. As an Orthodox Greek myself, researching this topic
is of high importance to me, intellectually as well as spiritually. As a
Humanities major, I have studied the Bible as a intellectual and literary
source of knowledge, and now I want to provide a deeper look at the
religious and faith aspects as well. I will provide a descriptive
analysis of the Church, providing information on literature,
traditions, and the liturgy. I also will provide a brief overview of
differences between the Orthodox Christian faith and the Catholic and 
Protestant Christian faiths. <hr>

<P>

<H1>A General Overview of Who Is an Orthodox Christian:</H1><BR>

An <A HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">Orthodox 
Christian</A> takes her or his beliefs from two sources:  "the Scriptures 
and [the] Sacred Tradition" (<A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">The Orthodox 
Christian</A>).  The Orthodox Christian belongs to the 
body of Christ, which through time, has transformed into the "Church of Christ" (<A 
HREF= "http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">The Orthodox 
Christian</A>).  In 
Orthodoxy, this Church of Christ is essentially the accumulation of descendants from the 
original congregation "which was born at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in 
Jerusalem on Pentecost" (<A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">The Orthodox 
Christian</A>).  This first congregation was called 
an <A HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">ecclesia</A>.  
The Apostles were the first priests, who then passed on the position and tradition 
to the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html">priests</A> of 
the oncoming generations.

<P>

<H2>The Bible in Relation to Holy Tradition in the Orthodox Faith</H2><BR>

In Orthodoxy, the Bible in only part of the richness of Christian tradition.  
Although Orthodox Christians turn to the Bible for wisdom and guidance, they do 
not resort only on the Bible for information on how to live.  The Bible, or Holy 
Scripture, is only part of the Holy Tradition.  For Orthodox Christians, while the 
<A HREF="http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html" 
>Holy Scripture</A> is a "beautiful gem" (<A 
HREF="file://localhost/u3/ea/easu1569/ics.1c/finalpaper.html">The Bible and Holy 
Tradition</A>) and a central part of Orthodoxy, 
it's power will only manifest itself when one places it in the context of the 
larger <A 
HREF="http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html">Holy 
Tradition</A>.


<P>

<H2>History of the Orthodox Church</H2><BR>

The Orthodox church was <A 
HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html">founded</A> by 
Jesus Christ and His disciples; the 
faith and rituals continue to grow now for twenty centuries.  Although 
Orthodox Christians exist in other cultures and countries as well, 
most of them are "Greek, Russian, Egyptian, Romanian, Serbian, Ukrainian, 
Armenian, Bulgarian, Albanian, Ethiopian, [or] Syrian" (<A 
HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html" >The Orthodox Christian 
Fellowship Homepage</A>) in 
their <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html">ethnicity</A>.
<P>
Orthodox believers adhere to the <A 
HREF="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt">Nicene 
Creed</A>, which is 
the most widely accepted statement used in the Christian faith.  It is a "Common Ground" 
(<A 
HREF="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt">The 
Nicence Creed</A>) to the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, 
Lutheran, Calvinist, and other Christian churches.  The creed was created to 
support strongly the fact that "Jesus was fully 
God" (<A 
HREF="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt">The 
Nicene Creed</A>).  In other words, He was a part 
of the one God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and not just a creation that 
God made.

<H2>Some Differences Between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic and 
Protestant Churches</H2><BR>

<P>

<B>The Orthodox and the Protestant Churches</B><BR>

One of the main differences between the Orthodox and the <A 
HREF="http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html"> 
Protestant Church</A> lies precisely in the varying weight they place on the Holy 
Scriptures.  Both churches adhere to the <A
HREF="http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html">
centrality
</A> of the Bible in their faiths.  However, for the Protestant, the Bible is the 
only source of guidance, while for the Orthodox, the Bible is only part of 
the Holy 
Tradition.  The Orthodox doctrine finds a key problem with the Protestant stance:  
"gradually all of Holy Tradition has been stripped away either because someone 
didn't like this or that piece or perhaps the true beauty of a portion 
was tarnished and it was tossed away without knowing its true value or 
perhaps a cheap 
substitute attempting to replace that which was lost was done away with 
etc. until 
all that remains of the Tradition of the Church is the Bible," writes <A
HREF="http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html">Father 
David Moser</A>.

<P>

<B>The Orthodox and the Catholic Churches</B><BR>

The Orthodox Church differs from the Catholic Church as well:  about 500 
years before the reformation split western Europe into Protestants and 
Roman Catholics, the Orthodox protested against the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html">Pope
</A> and his authority.  The Orthodox had two main reasons for refusing 
the Pope.  Firstly, they did not agree with his attempts to become "supreme over the 
church" (<A HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html"> 
Some Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church</A>) in the 11th century.  Secondly, they 
were against the fact 
that the Pope proposed "some doctrinal innovations" (<A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html">
Some Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church</A>).  Because the Church 
until 
that point had remained "unchanged in doctrine and faith since the early Church of the 
Apostles" (<A HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html">
Some Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church </A>), the Orthodox 
rejected the changes of the Pope (and 
thus, of the Roman Catholics).  The Orthodox Church does 
consider itself "Catholic," however, in another sense; it is "whole and not confined" (<A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html">Some Straight 
Answers about the Orthodox Church</A>) in nature.

<P>

<H1>The Coptic Orthodox Church</H1><BR>

<P>

<H2>A Look Into the Coptic Orthodox Church</H2><BR>

<P>

As previously mentioned, Orthodox Christians are prevalent in several 
different cultures.  Although they are virtually the same in doctrine and 
practice, it will be useful to focus on a particular segment in more 
detail.  I will focus on the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt because it 
offers the most information in the internet.

<P>

 The Coptic Orthodox Church is a "very conservative Church,
which preserves most carefully the Christian Faith, in its earliest and purest
form,  passed on  from generation  to  generation,  unaltered  and true to the
Apostolic doctrine and patterns of worship" (<A 
HREF="ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt">Copts 
Through the Ages</A>).  Furthermore, it is a "deeply spiritual and even
mystical Church,  with an emphasis upon holiness,  and the Mysteries of Faith,
but at the same time it is a strongly <A 
HREF="ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt">doctrinal 
Church</A>" (<A 
HREF="ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt">Copts 
Through the Ages</A>) that not 
only adheres to the Scripture, but also to the teachings of the holy Apostles.

<P>

The word <A HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html"> 
Copt</A> derives from the word "Aigyptos," a Greek word which refers to 
the first capitol of Ancient Egypt.  However, the modern use of the 
word <A 
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Coptic</A> 
refers to the Egyptian Orthodox Christians.  The Coptic Church is 
based on <A 
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Saint 
Mark's teachings</A>.  The religion is very old, for "Saint 
Mark...brought Christianity to Egypt" (<A 
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html"> 
The Christian Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt</A>) during the first centuty, only a 
dozen years after Jesus ascended into heaven.  The <A 
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Coptic 
religion</A> is authentic in that it dates back almost to the beginning of
the Orthodox Church, but also in that some have discovered part of <A 
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Saint John's 
gospel</A> written in the Coptic language.

<P>

<H2>The Coptic Church's Contributions to the Orthodox Faith</H2><BR>

<P>

The Copts have made numerous contributions to the Orthodox faith 
as a whole.  Saint Mark was one of the first contributers, for he "had  
opened  the  first  Christian
Catechetical School in Alexandria for the instruction of the new converts" (<A 
HREF="ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt">Copts 
Through the Ages</A>).  Other Coptic saints made lasting contributions as well.  
For 
instance,  <A HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Saint 
Athanasius</A>, a Copt 
and the Pope of Alexandria in 381 A.D., authored the above mentioned 
<A HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Nicene Creed</A>. 
Furthermore,  <A
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">monasticism</A> 
grew out of Egypt, 
and subscribed to the character of "humbleness and submission" (<A
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Nicene Creed</A>).  
Later, <A HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Saint 
Anthony</A>, a Copt, was the first Christian monk during the last years of 
the third century.  Also a
Copt,  <A
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html">Saint 
Pachom</A> later established the rules of monasticism.

<P>

<H1>Orthodoxy on the Internet</H1><BR>
 
<P>

Orthodox Christians have offered their knowledge and information on the 
internet in various ways.  Different priests and other Orthodox Christians 
have submitted papers, homepages, and more online.  One who is interested in 
the Orthodox religion can research specific documents on the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/Orthodox.html">Orthodox 
Page</A>.  This document provides information about Orthodoxy; 
furthermore, it links one to other Orthodox sources online.

<P>

On the internet one can find an exact copy of the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/liturgy/liturgy.html">Divine 
Liturgy</A>  in its entirety. This includes both what the deacon says and 
what the congregation responds.  One also can find a large collection of 
general, as well as <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/prayers/prayers.html">Orthodox 
prayers</A> from which to choose.  The list includes The Lord's Prayer, The 
Creed, Morning Prayers, Prayers at Mealtime, Evening Prayers, and prayers by 
different saints (<A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/prayers/prayers.html">Orthodox 
Prayers</A>).  In addition, one also can view <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/icons/icons.html">Orthodox 
Icons</A> on screen, both with and without inline images.  

<P>

One document addresses and answers <A 
HREF="file://localhost/u3/ea/easu1569/ics.1c/finalpaper.html">specific 
questions</A> that one might have about the Orthodox 
faith.  Such questions include, for instance, "Do the Orthodox worship 
pictures when they worship icons?" and "Do you have to confess your sins to a 
priest and why?"  Such fundamental questions that one might have about 
Orthodoxy are ideal to answer on the internet because the answers are easy 
to access and are open for any wandering mind to explore--both Orthodox and 
non-Orthodox. 

<P>

Furthermore, The Orthodox keep an update on the internet, with 
documents on the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/news/news.html">Orthodox 
News Page</A> and on the <A 
HREF="http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/info/info.html">Orthodox 
Information Page</A>.

<P>

Interestingly, while information exists about Orthodoxy as a whole, one could 
not access easily sources on Orthodox churches from particular 
cultures.  As is evident in the depth of analysis of my paper, the <A 
HREF="http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/WebQuery?orthodox+christian">
Coptic Orthodox Christians</A>  
made available the most information about their religion on the internet.

<P>
