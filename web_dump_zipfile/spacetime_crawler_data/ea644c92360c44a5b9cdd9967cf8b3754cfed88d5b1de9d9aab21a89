      <h2>8. Mixed Raster Content Mode</h2>
      <p>
            This section defines the Mixed Raster Content mode or Profile M of
            TIFF for facsimile. Implementations of this profile are required to
            implement Profiles S and C, and may optionally implement Profiles F,
            J and L.
         
      </p><a name="sub1"></a><h3>8.1. Overview</h3>
      
      <pre>
   Unlike previous fax modes, which use a single coding method and
   spatial resolution for an entire fax page, the Mixed Raster Content
   mode [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>] enables different coding methods and resolutions within a
   single page. For example, consider a page that contains black-and-
   white text, which is best coded with MMR or JBIG, a color bar chart,
   best coded with JBIG, and a scanned color image, best coded with
   JPEG. Similarly, while spatial resolution of 400 pixels per inch may
   be best for the black-and- white text, 200 pixel per inch is usually
   sufficient for a color image.

   Rather than applying one coding method and resolution to all
   elements, MRC allows multiple coders and resolutions within a page.
   By itself, MRC does not define any new coding methods or resolutions.
   Instead it defines a 3-layer image model for structuring and
   combining the scanned image data. The MRC 3-layer model has been
   applied here using the TIFF format to yield a data structure which
   differs from [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>] though it applies the same coding methods, uses
   the same compressed image data stream and is consistent with the TIFF
   principle of a single IFD per image.
</pre>
      <a name="sub1sub1"></a><h3>8.1.1. MRC 3-layer model</h3>
      
      <pre>
   The 3 layers of the MRC model are Foreground and Background, which
   are both multi-level, and Mask, which is bi-level. Each layer may
   appear only once on a page and is coded independently of the other
   two. In our earlier example, the black-and-white text could be in the
   Mask layer, the color chart in the Foreground layer, and the color
   image in the Background layer.

   Each layer is an image and, when present, is represented by at least
   one IFD in a TIFF file. This is consistent with TIFF, which provides
   fields to define the attributes, such as resolution, image size, bits
   per sample, etc., of a single image or layer. The distribution of
   content among layers is determined by the writer, as is the choice of
   coding method, color encoding and spatial resolution for a layer.

   The final image is obtained by using the Mask layer to select pixels
   from the other two layers. When the Mask layer pixel value is 1, the
   corresponding pixel from the Foreground layer is selected; when it is
   0, the corresponding pixel from the Background layer is selected.
   Details are given in the Introduction of [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>].

   Not all pages, and not all parts of a page, require 3 layers. If
   there is only one layer present, then that layer is the primary image
   or IFD. If there is more than one layer, then the Mask must be one of
   the layers, in which case it is the primary image and it must be page
   size.

   MRC allows a page to be split into strips, with a variable number of
   scanlines in a strip. A strip can have 1, 2 or 3 layers. A single,
   stripped layer may be stored as a single, stripped image in an IFD,
   e.g., all strips associated with the Background layer may be treated
   as a single image. Alternatively, each strip associated with a layer
   may be stored as a separate image or IFD, e.g., the Background layer
   can be composed of several images that are offset vertically with
   respect to the page. In this case, there can be no overlap between
   images associated with a single layer. According to [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997" href="chapter11.html#T.4">T.4</a>] Annex G,
   strips having more than 1 layer SHOULD NOT be more than 256 lines in
   length unless the capability to receive longer strips has been
   negotiated.

   Furthermore, color fax also requires the spatial resolutions of
   Background and Foreground images to be legal fax values that are also
   integer factors of the Mask image resolution. For example, if the
   Mask Layer resolution is 400 pixels per inch, then allowed
   resolutions for the Foreground and Background layers are 100, 200 or
   400 pixels per inch; if the Mask is at 300 pixels per inch, then
   allowed values are 100 and 300. The Foreground and Background layer
   resolutions can be independently set.
</pre>
      
      <a name="sub1sub2"></a><h3>8.1.2. A TIFF Representation for the MRC 3-layer model</h3>
      
      <pre>
   In the TIFF representation of the 3-layer MRC model, each page is
   represented by a single IFD, called the Primary IFD, that represents
   the Mask layer (unless the Foreground or Background is the single
   layer present), and a set of child IFDs that are referenced through
   the SubIFDs extension field [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>]. To distinguish MRC-specific

   SubIFDs from other SubIFDs, the NewSubFileType field MUST have Bit 4
   ON, indicating an MRC-related IFD. A new ImageLayer field is also
   introduced that consists of two values that identify the layer
   (Foreground, Background, or Mask) and the order within the layer
   (first, second, ... image of the layer); see Section 8.2.3.

   Because MRC allows strips with variable numbers of scanlines, a
   reader MUST support StripRowCounts field because a writer may use it
   in place of the RowsPerStrip field in this mode. The StripRowCounts
   field allows each layer, with a variable number of scanlines in each
   strip, to be represented by a single IFD, when the coding parameters
   are the same for all strips in the layer. The MRC standard [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>]
   allows the Foreground and Background layers to have strips with
   different coding parameters. In this case, a separate IFD is required
   to represent the strips which use different coding parameters; see
   text in next paragraph. In all cases, the Mask layer is required to
   be represented by a single IFD and a single set of coding parameters.

   The use of SubIFDs to store child IFDs is described in [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>]. An
   example is shown graphically below. The Primary IFD associated with
   page 1 (PrimaryIFD 0) points to page 2 (PrimaryIFD 1) with the
   nextIFD offset. The Primary IFD, corresponding to the Mask layer
   (ImageLayer=[2,1]), contains a SubIFDs field that points to a list of
   child IFDs. The first child IFD represents one image of the
   Background layer, i.e., ImageLayer=[1,1]. This child IFD points to
   the second child IFD via the nextIFD offset. This child represents
   the second Background layer image, ImageLayer=[1,2]. Finally, the
   second child points to the third child, which corresponds to the
   single Foreground layer image, ImageLayer=[3,1]. The next IFD offset
   associated with this Foreground image is 0, indicating no more child
   IFDs exist. Each primary IFD has the NewSubFileType set to 18,
   indicating the IFD is MRC-specific (bit 4) and that it is a single
   page of a multi-page document (bit 1). Each child IFD has the
   NewSubFileType set to 16, indicating the IFD is MRC-specific. The 'V'
   character should be read as a down-pointing arrow.

                       (nextIFD)
       PRIMARY IFD 0  ------------&gt; PRIMARY IFD 1--&gt; ...
           ImageLayer = [2,1]
           NewSubFileType = 18
           SubIFDs
                |
                V
             Child IFD
                ImageLayer = [1,1]
                NewSubFileType = 16
                |
                |(nextIFD)

                |
                V
             Child IFD
                ImageLayer = [1,2]
                NewSubFileType = 16
                |
                |(nextIFD)
                |
                V
             Child IFD
                ImageLayer = [3,1]
                NewSubFileType = 16
                |
                |(nextIFD)
                V
                0

   In the example above, the SubIFDs field of the Primary IFD points to
   the first IFD in a list of child IFDs. TIFF allows the SubIFDs field
   to point to an array of IFDs, each of which can be the first of a
   list of IFDs. An MRC-enabled TIFF reader must scan all available
   child IFDs to locate and identify IFDs associated with MRC layers.

   In the case where the Background or Foreground layers are described
   with multiple IFDs, the XPosition and YPosition TIFF fields specify
   the offset to the upper-left corner of the IFD with respect to the
   Mask layer; see Section 8.2.2. When there is only a single layer
   (Mask, Foreground, or Background), it is stored as the Primary IFD.

      <a name="sub2"></a><h3>8.2. Required TIFF Fields</h3>
      
      <pre>
   This section describes the TIFF fields required, in addition to those
   in Section 2.2.1, to represent MRC mode fax images. Since MRC mode
   stores fax data as a collection of images corresponding to layers or
   parts of layers, the coding methods, color encodings and spatial
   resolutions used by previous modes apply to MRC. Therefore, the
   descriptions here will typically reference the appropriate earlier
   section. Fields and values specific to MRC mode are pointed out.
</pre>
      <a name="sub2sub1"></a><h3>8.2.1. Baseline Fields</h3>
      
      <pre>
ImageWidth(256).                                           SHORT or LONG
    Same page widths as the base color mode; see Section 6.2.1.
    In the MRC mode, the width of a Foreground or Background image in
    the coded data stream may be less than the page width. In this case,
    the image width in the coded data steam is used to interpret the
    coded data, and the value of this field is used as the page width.

NewSubFileType(254) = 16, 18.                                       LONG
    For MRC fax mode, the NewSubFileType field has two bits that are
    required.
    Bit 1 indicates a single page of a multi-page document and must be
    set for the Primary IFD;
    Bit 4 indicates MRC imaging model as described in ITU-T
    Recommendation T.44 [<a title="ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997." href="chapter11.html#T.44">T.44</a>], and must be set for Primary IFDs
    and all MRC-specific child IFDs.

    RequiredByTIFFBaseline
    Profile F readers must be able to read data in both bit orders,
    but the vast majority of facsimile products store data LSB
    first, exactly as it appears on the telephone line.
              1 = Most Significant Bit first.
              2 = Least Significant Bit first

ResolutionUnit(296) = 2, 3.                                        SHORT
PhotometricInterpretation(262) = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10.                   SHORT
    For Mask layer, see Sections 4.2.1 and 5.2.1.
    For Foreground and Background layers, see Sections 6.2.1 and 7.2.1.

ColorMap(320).                                                     SHORT

    Used when Foreground or Background layer is a palette-color image;
    see Section 7.2.1.

XResolution(282) = 100, 200, 300, 400.                          RATIONAL
YResolution(283) = 100, 200, 300, 400.                          RATIONAL
    The resolution of the image is expressed in pixels per resolution
    unit. In pixels per inch, allowed XResolution values for all layers
    are: 100, 200, 300, and 400. MRC color fax mode requires the pixels
    to be square, hence YResolution must equal XResolution for all
    layers. The resolution of Background and Foreground layers must each
    be an integer factor of the Primary image, which is the Mask layer,
    when it is present; see Section 8.4.
    See Section 2.2.2 for inch-metric equivalency.

    Count = number of child IFDs
    Each value is an offset from the beginning of the TIFF file to a
    child IFD [<a title="Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf" href="chapter11.html#TTN1">TTN1</a>].

YPosition(287).                                                 RATIONAL
    Specifies the horizontal and vertical offsets of the top-left of the
    IFD from the top-left of the Primary IFD in page resolution units.
    For example, if the Primary IFD is at 400 pixels per inch, and a
    foreground layer IFD is at 200 pixels per inch and located at pixel
    coordinate (345, 678) with respect to the Primary IFD, the XPosition
    value is 345/400 and the YPosition value is 678/400.
    Color fax does not currently allow overlap of any component images
    within a single layer.
    Default values for XPosition and YPosition are 0.

Decode(433).                                                   SRATIONAL

DefaultImageColor(434).                                            SHORT
    Count = SamplesPerPixel
    In areas where no image data is available, a default color is needed
    to specify the color value. If the StripByteCounts value for a strip
    is 0, then the color for that strip must be defined by a default
    image color.

    The DefaultImageColor field uses the same encoding as the image
    data, and its value is therefore interpreted using the
    PhotometricInterpretation, SamplesPerPixel, BitsPerSample, and
    Indexed fields. If the fax data stream requires a different
    encoding, then transferring the default color value between a TIFF
    file and fax data stream requires a color conversion.
    For the Foreground layer image, the default value for the
    DefaultImageColor field is black. For other cases, including the
    Background layer image, the default value is white.

StripRowCounts(559).                                                LONG
    Count = number of strips
    The number of scanlines stored in a strip. MRC allows each fax strip
    to store a different number of scanlines. For strips with more than
    one layer there is a maximum strip size of 256 scanlines or full
    page size. The 256 maximum SHOULD be used unless the capability to
    receive longer strips has been negotiated. This field replaces
    RowsPerStrip for IFDs with variable-sized strips. Only one of the
    two fields, StripRowCounts and RowsPerStrip, may be used in an IFD.

ImageLayer (34732).                                       SHORT or LONG.
    Count = 2
    Image layers are defined such that layer 1 is the Background layer,
    layer 3 is the Foreground layer, and layer 2 is the Mask layer,
    which selects pixels from the Background and Foreground layers. The
    ImageLayer tag contains two values, describing the layer to which
    the image belongs and the order in which it is imaged.

    ImageLayer[0] = 1, 2, 3.
    1: Image is a Background image, i.e., the image that will appear
       whenever the Mask contains a value of 0. Background images
       typically contain low-resolution, continuous-tone imagery.
    2: Image is the Mask layer. In MRC, if the Mask layer is present, it
       must be the Primary IFD and be full page in extent (no gaps.)
    3: Image is a Foreground image, i.e., the image that will appear
       whenever the Mask contains a value of 1. The Foreground image
       generally defines the color of text or lines, but may also
       contain high-resolution imagery.

    ImageLayer[1]:
    1: first image to be imaged in this layer,
    2: second image to be imaged in this layer,
    3: ...

    Value describing the image order. In MRC, this may be considered
    the strip number. Since MRC mode currently does not allow overlap
    between images within a layer, the order value does not have any
    visual effect.

   In MRC fax mode, it is possible that only a single layer is
   transmitted. For example, if a page contains only a single
   continuous-tone photograph, then only the Background layer may be
   transmitted. In this case, the Background layer will be stored as the
   Primary IFD. ImageLayer[0] will be 1 indicating Background;
   ImageLayer[1] will be 1 since there can be no other IFDs associated
   with that layer. No Mask layer will exist.

   See Sections 2.2.3. and 2.2.4.
</pre>
      <a name="sub4"></a><h3>8.4. Rules and Requirements for Images</h3>
      
      <pre>
   The MRC mode defines a fundamental set of rules for images in the 3-
   layer representation.

   1. If more than one layer exists, then the binary Mask layer SHALL be
      present and be the primary image. The Mask layer SHALL support the
      encoding defined in Section 3 and MAY support the encodings
      defined in Sections 4 and 5. If only one layer exists, then the
      image corresponding to that layer is the primary image.

   2. When the binary Mask layer is the Primary IFD, the Primary IFD
      defines and extends to the entire page boundary; all attached
      model images cannot extend beyond the Primary image. Resolution
      differences may cause some pixels to "hang over" the page
      boundary, but no new pixels should exist completely beyond the
      page extent. When the Foreground or Background layer is the
      Primary IFD, the Primary IFD may not be page width.

   3. The Background and Foreground images SHALL support the color
      encoding defined in Section 6 and MAY support the color encoding
      defined in Section 7. These images MAY optionally cover only a
      portion of the strip or page.

   4. Each Primary IFD and each MRC-specific SubIFD must have an
      ImageLayer field to specify which layer the IFD belongs to, and
      the imaging order of that IFD within the layer.

   5. Each Primary IFD must have a NewSubFileType field value set to 18,
      indicating a single page of a multi-page document (bit 1) and MRC
      mode (bit 4).

   6. Each MRC-specific child IFD must have a NewSubFileType field value
      set to 16, indicating MRC mode (bit 4).

   7. In MRC mode, each layer is transmitted as a sequence of strips. It
      is possible that each strip of each layer can be stored as a
      separate IFD. In this case, the SubIFDs structure pointed to by
      the Primary IFD will contain several IFDs that have an ImageLayer
      field with the layer identified as either Background (layer 1) or
      Foreground (layer 3). There may be no overlap in the vertical
      direction between IFDs associated with a single layer, although
      there may be a gap from one of these images to the next. The TIFF
      XPosition and YPosition fields are used to indicate the placement
      of these images with respect to the primary image.

   8. When the Mask image is present, the resolution of Background and
      Foreground images must each be an integer factor of the Mask
      image. For example, if the Mask image is 400 pixels/inch, then the
      Background or Foreground image may be at 400 pixels/inch (400/1),
      200 pixels/inch (400/2) or 100 pixels/inch (400/4).
