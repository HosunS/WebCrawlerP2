Hi,
I am an amateur genealogist researching my family history. Pesach Langsam
(1748 - 1820) had several children, the oldest one never having adopted the
surname LANGSAM (but rather Miller, from whom I descend).
Would you perhaps be interested in exploring a possible connection to the
original Pesach Langsam? I have a website with a fair amount of detail on
his descendents. It is at
www.langsam.com


I look forward to your response.

Hi,
Saw your site through Family Tree Maker. I am working on a LANGSAM family tree 
and was wondering if you could supply any more information. In your tree there is:
7. MYRA LEAH3 CROOG (EVELYN DIANA2 AARONSON, SAMUEL DAVID1) was born September 1,
1934 in New Haven, CT. She married EUGENE ALFRED LANGSAM September 23, 1962. 
      
Children of MYRA CROOG and EUGENE LANGSAM are: 
 
             i.
               
                NATHANIA ANN4 LANGSAM, b. July 19, 1963, Far Rockaway, New
                York.
 
            ii.
               
                JENNY SUSAN LANGSAM, b. July 12, 1965, Far Rockaway, New York;
                m. DAVID JAY KOPELMAN, March 23, 1996.


Do you know of any more detail on the Langsam side of that branch? 

Thanks!

I forwarded your e-mail to the appropriate members of the family.  The

don't know much more than what was listed in the family tree.  I hope their 
communication with you helps!

Hi,
I have more data than what is posted and was wondering if you might be 
able to just outline the oldest known LANGSAM ancestry that you are aware 
of. The bulk of Pesach Langsam's offspring lived in Galicia and Slovakia, 
although by 1900 there were descendants living on six continents.
Thanks!

even a little. What I have is

A. Croog (not Samuel Aaronson). Nathania's middle name is Ann (not
Anna). Eugene's parents were Nathan Langsam (d. March l963) at the age
of 65. Mother of Eugene was Bessie Langsam nee Laks9 (d. July 1983). Any
other info requested must be more specific

Hi,
Thanks so much for the reply. I am researching the LANGSAM family genealogy and have a 
website devoted to this at www.langsam.com

Can you tell me who Nathans' parents were? 
Where were they from ?
Did Nathan have any siblings?

Thanks so much!

Hi! The only question I can respond to is the one about Nat's brothers.  I know
he did have one, two or three. But as my husband passed away I really have
little recall on this matter.  I do know that one of his brothers was Abraham
who I think was a doctor at the Veteran's Hospital in Coney Island years ago.
He also had two nephews who I remember, Nat and Ben who were brothers and lived
in Brooklyn.  One I know was a lawyer, the other I can't recall.  All I do
remember about them is that they were very nice guys.  Hope this helps a
little.
Myra

Subject: Saul Langsam Family

Hi,
Thanks so much. This was just enough detail for me to place the family. You can view the specific page in my site that deals with this general branch, starting with Saul Langsam, circa 1830's. 

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/saul.htm

or a more general reference at

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/langsam.htm

That being said, perhaps I can trouble you for two more pieces of information:
 How many children did Nat have?
 Would any of them (or their offspring) be interested in the family genealogy?

Thanks again so much for your help and information!

Hi! Sorry, but that's about all of the info I have on the family.  Wish I could
answer the questions you now have, but al least I'm glad that I could help you out
a bit.
