<h2>Our Astral Friends;  Comets.</h2>

<h2>An Introduction ToComets</h2>
<p>
<a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html">Comets
</a> are astral matter that have been surrounded by legend, myth, and 
intrigue for centuries. As long as man and creatures have roamed the 
earth, comets could be seen in the sky.  The Chinese have been 
observing <a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html"> 
Halley's Comet</a> since 240 B.C. and was viewed as <a href="
http://eyes.gsfc.nasa.gov/">phenomena</a> that occured only in the 
atmosphere until 
1577.  Then a man named Tycho Brahe proved that they were not atmospheric 
elements, but rather celestial bodies.  Since then, obviously astronomy has 
learned much more information about comets.  But even in today's highly 
scientific era, much of the information we now have on comets is 
based on theory from gathered data.    <p>


<h2>What Is A Comet?</h2>
<img src="comet.gif"><p>
Comets are commonly known as "dirty snowballs" or large balls of cosmic 
dust and ice.  They are left over pieces of astral matter that for one 
reason or another was not involved in the formation of <a 
href=<http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html">planets</a> or moons when the universe was first born.  A comet is formed around a centrally located disk called a coma. Surrounding the coma are many fragments of elments that are commonly
 found in space.  The "tail" of the comet is consistes of hydrogen, 
carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.  All of these radicals can be broken away 
from methane, ammonia, and water which all can exist as ices.  What is 
also intetresting to note is that comets do not follow Newtonian 
gravitational laws which suggests the theory that the escaping gases 
produce  a force which hurls the comet through space.  Short lived comets 
also lose force with time, which suggests that they are similar to 
burning torches, running on only a given amount of fuel.
The head of a comet, including the hazy coma, can exceed the size of <a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">earth</a>.  That is a scary thought, considering that one day a comet may colliode with our planet.  
<h2>How The <a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html">Sun</a> Effects Comets</h2>
<p>
A comet is approaching the sun by way ofa great gravitational pull.  As 
the ball of gases and ice gets nearer to the sun's extreme heat, the 
high temperatures cause the comet to become visible.  The molecules of 
the comet are blown away by the solar wind at a speed of 250 miles per 
second.  As a comet's orbit takes it away from the sun, the reduced heat 
and solar wind causes the tail to receed.  So all of the comets that yuou 
and I see pictures of are neer the sun, since the tails are long and 
magnificent.  The nearer to the 
sun, the more visible the comet.  The sun's gravitational pull causes 
comets to have an elliptical orbit.  The orbits are so vast that it 
carries the astral body far out of the solar system. There is also a 
direct relationship between comets and meteor showers.  When a comet 
comes relatively close to earth, the debris given off by the tail creates 
a meteor shower as it falls into our atmosphere.   


<h2>The Importance Of Comets</h2>
<p>

Comets have an effect on our present, past, and future.  Currently they 
are an object of fasciniation and may hold with it the secrets of the 
formation of the universe.  Spawned at the dawn of time, comets may 
help to explain how the dinasaurs came to be extinct.  There is a large 
crater off the eastern coast of Central America that is believed to be an 
impact crater caused by a comet or <a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html">asteroid</a>. .  
This may explain 
the mysterious dissapearing act put on by our plant's previous tennants.  
As we look to the future, the question of whether or not a catastrophic 
event like this could happen again.  The chances of a the elliptical 
orbit of a comit crossing the path of the earth is very small.  However, 
if the head of the comet were to hit a populated area, there would be 
much death and destruction.  Our fate would be in the hands of <a 
href="ttp://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html">NASA</a> to stop the 
collision.  As of this year(1995), 878 comets have been recognized by 
science.  They are a relevant part of our <a 
href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html"> 
solar system</a>
