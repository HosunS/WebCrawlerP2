Mr. Miller,
     
     I am not the historian in the family, so I am unable to give you 
an answer as to whether the person that you mention is my relative. 
What I do know is that all of the Langsams in my family are from a 
small village in southwestern Poland. I can ask my 90 year old father 
the name of the area to see if this may help you decide if we are 
distanly related.
     
Andy.

Mr. Miller,
     
      I have faxed my father a request for family history today (he 
does not use the net yet) and I expect that he will get back to me in 
a few days or so. 
     I do have access to the net and would be very interested in a 
Langsam home page.
     I also know that when my parents were in Israel that the met 
cousins in Nahariya that the did not know existed. They, too came 
from the same town in Poland, and in fact, my brother, Mark was named 
for the same man that this person in Nahariya was named after.
     I'll keep you posted.
     
Sincerely,
     
Andrew Langsam

Mr. Miller,
     
     My father relates that we are listed in the Langsam/Spira book 
on page H-11.
     
     His grandfathers name was Itzhak David ben Schmuel and he 
married a Malka Snell.
     
     Itzhak was born in a village called Sansk and he later moved to 
a village called Bircza by Sanok, where he met and married his wife.
     
     It had always been told, and joked, that there was the Langsam 
side of the family and the Snell (schnell) side of the family.
     
     Keep me posted about the home page.
     
Andrew Langsam

Hi Moishe,
     
     I'm not the geneologist in the family. All I have is the 
information which I gave you from my father. And he says that we are 
the family listed in section H-11 in the Spira/Langsam book. That's 
all I know, and the information that I sent to you yesterday is all 
that he sent to me.
     
Sincerely,

I'll call the Einhorns very soon though I doubt that it will come
to much beyond what we know about the previous generations or how they are
connected to the main tree. Our information came from two members of the family who were
more connected to Europe than anyone living today and I don't expect that we will
find out anything startling.  However, I will follow up given that there is
a known Bircza connection and we seem to be on a path with many branches leading to
Bircza.

Once again I will ask my mother Leila to get back to you (I see that

name is Langsam.  Her madien nam was Sarah Langsam but now goes by Sarah
Carroll.

Her Father lives in the DC area and I am not sure where her grandmother
is now living she used to spend half the year in Israel.  Is there any

Hi,
Thanks for thinking of me regarding the LANGSAM connection. I would be
most interested in pursuing this further. Virtually all the LANGSAM's stem
from Pesach Langsam, born circa 1748. Does she have email?

Sure, Sarah's e-mail address is: scarroll30@hotmail.com

Don't know how much she knows about her geneology but you can give it a try.
Also since her grandmother is still living she may know some of the family's
history.

Dear Sarah,
Jessica and I were exploring a potential familial relation and she
mentioned that your maiden name is LANGSAM. I am a direct descendent of
Pesach Langsam (c1748 - c1820) and have been working on a family tree for
quite some time. Would you be interested in exploring a possible connection
between our families? I have a website with quite a bit of information on
his offspring at
www.langsam.com

You can reach me at

Thanks for your time!

your ancestry might already be there. Can you tell me your grandfather's

Here's what the Einhorn folks wrote:

Elsie Hoffer was the person who wrote back.  She contacted the widow of a
cousin for some information but the widow knew nothing. Elsie provided a rather
disjointed account of the family.  I think I'll have to sort it all out
and get back to you.  The widow gave a couple of addresses which I will
include when I send you what I know....which is not much.  One of the addresses is in
Israel and the other is in Poland.  One of the relatives stayed in Poland and married
there (to a non-Jew) after the war.  I doubt that much will come of these
contacts.

Hi,
Thanks for your kind words and feedback. There are actually two ways you can help. 
Firstly, in the "book" it lists Mark and Marsha Beth as the two children of Alexander.
The seven grandchildren listed are Frederic Ian, Sarah Michelle, Jonathan, Lawrence, 
Paul, Marni, and Paula. 

The first question I have is where do you and your "uncle Andy" fit?

Alexander's father was Aaron. His father was Itzhak David. His father was Shmuel. 

The second question is does anybody know more about Shmuel? His parents? Siblings? 
Other children? Do you know of other Langsam's not in the Itzhak David tree? When 
your grandfather passed away, did you hear of any "new" cousins? 

Anyhow, thanks again for your interest.

The nutshell is I have a theory that H6's Samuel (see  your 1988 update)
was the progenitor of H14, H15, H30 and H62. That is without the Louis
Langsam from Argentina (whoever that is). This seems to hold based on what
I have so far from various family. I also think that the cigar guy was from
H30 as well, via the Morris. For this to be true, the H30 tree needs to be
split. You mention in the original book that the tree was built open the
theory that the Polish data matched the letter Michael received. So I am
asking, must Frank's father be Leib? Do you have his death record or the
name of the cemetery for Frank?

Happy Purim!

I suspect that your theory is correct.  I have an H30 file and will take a crack at
going over what I have in light of your considerations.  By the way, I tried to
email you about the name on the passenger list last week but my message bounced so
I don't think you got it.  Bottom line, I couldn't make it out even with my German
handwriting aids.  I think it will require someone who really knows how to read old
German.  There are people at the National Archives branch on Vesey who volunteer to
help with requests such as these.

Dear Moishe:

My great grandfather, Isaac David Langsam, lived in the Bronx for many years 
a couple of blocks away from my grand parents, Aaron and Sarah Langsam. As a 
little boy, I remember visiting his shop where he lived in the back. We 
called his "Zaida." He moved to Long Beach, NY with Grandma and Grandpa 
Langsam in the early 1950's and lived in our house at 129 East Walnut Street 
until his death. I must have been about 10 or 11 when he died because I 
stayed with my Uncle Max and Aunt Helen that summer while he was failing. I 
remember him helping Grandpa (who was severely injured in a robbery of his 
dry goods store in the Bronx) walk to shul in Long Beach from our house. I 
believe he is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Lodi, NJ where Aaron Langsam 
and Sarah Langsam are also buried on the grounds of the Sons of the Galician 
Zionists, the shul and fraternal group in the Bronx where they davened.

Have you seen the Langsam-Spira genealogy? It was published about ten years 
ago. I have a copy somewhere in the house.

You can also speak to my mother, Genevieve Langsam Freiser, for more 
recollections and her sisters, Toby Lieberman (who lives in Long Beach) and 
Esther Marcus who lives in Beit Yanai, Israel.

Good luck and keep me posted.

Dear Joel,

Thanks so much for your comments. They are much appreciated. 

Regarding the book, I do own a copy and have been in touch with the authors. My 
branch originates with the L1 section of the book. 

I believe that your branch (H15)  and the branches labeled (in the book) H62, H6, 
and part of H30 all come from a common Samuel Langsam, who possibly had two wives. 

I would be most interested in communicating with your mother and aunts. Would you 
be able to supply some contact information? Do any of them have/use email?

Within my website I have an overview of your general family at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/saml-h15.htm
Your feedback would be most welcome.

Thanks again for taking the time to write,

Hi,

Thanks for your inquiry. You can find more detail on your own clan at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/lngsm-h.htm
Your branch is H15
You can click on if from that page or go directly to 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/saml-h15.htm

I do not have more information on your own Nathan branch than what is written 
there. I would be very grateful if you would be able to flesh out your own 
tree (from Nathan down).

As to where your tree fits in the large scope, I have a theory (only) that your
Shmuel may be connected to (or the same person as) the H6 Shmuel. 

Also, I met with an Aaron Langsam in Los Angeles this past August and he spoke 
of Schnell cousins. He is in branch H26, which I have not yet put up on the tree. 
Perhaps there is a broader connection.

I was under the impression from ship records that your overall family came from 
Bircza. Have you seen the entries for them on Ellis Island? I have many of the 
ship manifest images for the Langsam's.

Lastly, do you know of any other LANGSAM families, even if you do not know how 
they are related.

Thanks and happy new year!

Moshe:

I understand that you are involved in researching the Langsam family.  

My maternal grandmother's maiden name was Gertrude Langsam and her
family came from Przemysl.  Her father was Nathan Langsam and her mother
was Rayla Arem  Nathan Langsam's father was David Langsam and Nathan's
mother was Sarah(?) Schnell.  In addition to Nathan they had the
following children: Mordechai, Aron, Morris, Pauline, Annie and Rose.
These are obviously mostly the Anglicized names.

I learned all of this from my Grandmother before she passed away, and I
would be interested in acquiring any GED files that you might have that
might link my family to the larger Lansam/Spira family.

I can be reached at this email address or via phone at 416-783-5731.
Thank you for your time.
