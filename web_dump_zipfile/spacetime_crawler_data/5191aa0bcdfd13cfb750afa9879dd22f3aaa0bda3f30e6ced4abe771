LAW SCHOOLS ON THE WEB </B>
<hr>
     The World Wide Web has provided the opportunity for thousands and 
thousands of users to access knowledge about virtually any topic.  The 
popularity of the web is due in large part to the range of knowledge that 
is accessible.  The depth of knowledge in individual areas has been 
surprisingly good.  Part of the reason for this is because individual 
companies, institutions and agencies contribute to various fields.  
<p>
The field that I am most interested involves the legal field, and more 
specifically, law schools.  I have used the web over the course of the 
last several weeks to access information about law schools and more 
importantly, what they can provide to web users.  <A NAME="Q1">Of most 
importance, I tried to answer the following questions:</A>
<ol>
<li><A HREF="#T1"> What law schools provide information to web users?</A>
<li><A HREF="#T2"> Does the presentation or quality of this information 
differ from what is available through non-electronic means?</A>
<li><A HREF="#T3"> Which schools put out information of higher quality?</A>
<li><A HREF="#T4"> Which schools are pioneers in the field in terms of new 
and interesting ways to provide information via electronic means?</A>
</ol>
<p>
What I found was a bit surprising.  I entered this project with the 
assumption, however misinformed, that the better the law school, the 
better the web page.  And my assumptions also led me to believe that if a 
law school was not highly regarded in legal circles, it would in all 
probability have a web page that was rather non-spectacular.  Well my 
assumptions could not be further from the truth.  The top two law schools in 
the country, <A HREF="gopher://gopher.law.yale.edu/"> Yale</A> and 
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/11/.links/.LAW"> 
Harvard,</A> do not have web pages but rely on a gopher 
menu instead.  These menus are poorly developed and are not nearly as 
useful as 
some of the services provided by other law schools.  Conversely, one of the 
most interesting and innovative web pages is from 
<A HREF="http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/"> Case Western Reserve 
University law school,</A> ranked nowhere near the elite U.S. law schools.
<p>
My categorization of U.S. law schools that have web pages can be 
separated into three distinct groups.  The <A HREF="#T2">first 
group</A> is for law schools 
that are just getting started with the web.  These law schools lack the 
innovation of others, but are to be commended for experimenting with the 
web.  The <A HREF="#T3">second group</A> is comprised of law schools that 
offer intesting 
and detailed web pages that are useful for web users and prospective 
students.  These pages provide text and sometimes pictures that are 
helpful in learning about the school.  The <A HREF="#T4">third group</A> is 
comprised of 
the elite U.S. law schools in terms of their web pages, but not 
necessarily their legal reputation.  These schools have gone far beyond 
the typical web page and have experimented with innovative pages that are 
very useful to web users.  They are the legal pioneers of the web 
community.  My findings about law school web pages can be summarized by 
answering my four initial <A HREF="#Q1">questions</A> posed at the 
beginning of this paper.

<A NAME="Questions"><H2>Questions I Have Asked</H2></a>
<ol>
<li><A NAME="T1">What law schools provide information to web users? </A>
<p>
Unfortunately, less than half of the U.S. law schools provide pages for 
interested web users.  Courtesy of the <A 
HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/home.html">University of 
Southern California Law Library</A>, a listing of <A 
HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/librarys/locators.html"> law 
schools on the web</A> has been made available for those interested.  
Although the University of Southern California listing is the most 
comprehensive, there are other services which provide much of the same 
information.  <A 
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Law/Law_Schools/">Stanford 
University Law School</A> provides another listing of law schools on the 
web that is virtually identical to USC's listing. <A 
HREF="http://www.jmls.edu/law-sch.html"> John Marshall Law School</A> also 
provides a detailed representation of law schools available on the web. 
The John Marshall listing is unique because it differentiates the law 
schools based on whether or not they are a world wide web server or a 
gopher server.  Another listing of law schools on the web is provided by 
<A HREF="http://www.rutgers.edu/lawschool.html"> Rutgers University Law 
School</A> which lists the schools as part of its extensive web page.  
Finally, there is a listing of law schools and law firms on the world 
wide web that is provided by <A 
HREF="http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/lawother.html">Indiana University 
law school</A>.  This listing also contains law schools overseas in such 
places as Great Britain and Germany.
<p>
<A HREF="#Q1">Return to list of questions.</A>
 <p>
<li><A NAME="T2">Does the presentation or quality of this information 
differ from what is available through non-electronic means?</A>
<p>
For some law school web pages, the information available is no more 
particularly valuable than what is offered in catalog form (in some 
cases, the information is less worthwhile than printed information).  One 
example of a modest web page is the one offered by <A 
HREF="http://www.whittier.edu/www/lawhome.html#top">Whittier Law 
School</A>.  This page offers a brief description of the law school but 
there is little substantive information about courses, faculty or 
admissions statistics.  There are no pictures of the law school or 
surrounding area. <p> Perhaps the most pathetic menu is the one offered 
by one of the elite U.S. law schools:  <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/11/.links/.LAW">Harvard Law 
School.</A>  This web page has no graphics or pictures, not to mention a 
comprehensive table of contents.  The only thing that is offered is a listing
 of courses.  The
 <A HREF="gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/00/.LAW/.cdesc/LAWcoursealpha10">
course information</A> is presented in simple text form and could use 
some additional work.   The only law school in the country that is 
ranked higher than Harvard is <A HREF="gopher://gopher.law.yale.edu/"> 
Yale</A>.<p>  Yale's gopher-limited menu is 
rather mundane.  The information is standard and the presentation is 
non-spectacular.  The gopher menu that was produced by Yale is for the 
entire college rather than the law school itself.  Yale was kind enough 
to include a <A HREF="gopher://yaleinfo.yale.edu:105/2">Yale search 
directory</A> so I typed in 'law school' but was not overwhelmed with the 
results of my <A 
HREF="gopher://yaleinfo.yale.edu:105/2?law+school">search.</A>  The 
difference between web pages and gopher services really begins to show.
<p>
<A HREF="#Q1">Return to list of questions.</A>
<p>
<li><A NAME="T3">Which schools put out information of higher quality?</A>
<p>
Many law schools are beginning to put out information that is obviously 
of higher quality.  These web pages include pertinent information about 
the faculty, school, admissions and the surrounding community.  One 
example of this is the web page put forth by <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/lawschool.html">Stanford 
University Law School</A>.  Using this web page, users can access 
information about the <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/study.html"> study of
law at Stanford</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/student.html">student 
organizations</A>, the <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/faculty.html">faculty 
and deans</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/aid.html">financial 
aid.</A>  More personal information such as <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/childcare.html">child 
care</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/health.html">
health services</A> is also available.
<p>Another California law school, 
<A HREF="http://www.uchastings.edu/">Hastings College of the Law</A>, has 
distinguished itself by including a photograph of the law school on its 
web page (The <A HREF="http://www.law.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati 
College of Law</A> also provides a photograph of the law school).  Another 
useful tool on the Hastings web page is the <A 
HREF="http://www.uchastings.edu/feedback.html">feedback form</A> for 
comments.  For current legal topics, web users can access the 
<A HREF="http://www.uchastings.edu/womenslj/womenslj.html">
Hastings Women's Law Journal</A>.  This service provides "critical 
perspectives" on current topics such as the O.J. Simpson trial.  One of 
the law schools with a comprehensive description of its library is the <A 
HREF="http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/library/library.html">Tarlton Law 
Library</A> from the University of Texas at Austin.
<p>
<A HREF="#Q1">Return to list of questions.</A>
<p>
<li><A NAME="T4">Which schools are pioneers in the field in terms of new 
and interesting ways to provide information via electronic means?</A> 
<p>
There are three law schools that I believe to be the legal pioneers on 
the web.  The first is the 
<A HREF="http://felix.law.washington.edu/CondonHome.html"> University of 
Washington School of Law</A>.  I have selected this law school because of 
its listing of 
<A HREF="http://www.law.washington.edu/lawinternet/lawweb.html"> internet 
law resources</A>.  This service provides links for web users to
<A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/supct.table.html">
Supreme Court decisions</A>, <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/govdocs.html">
U.S. Government Hypertexts</A> and the 
<A HREF="gopher://aclu.org:6601/"> American Civil Liberties Union</A>.  
All of these services are useful and they help to enhance the quality of 
the <A HREF="http://felix.law.washington.edu/CondonHome.html">
University of Washington</A> home page.
<p>The second law school home page that is noticeably better than most 
others is the one provided by the 
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/home.html">
University of Southern California Law Center and Law Library.</A>  This 
web page provides access to 
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/topiclst.html">
federal legal resources</A> as well as
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/ca.html">
California legal resources.</A>  USC did not stop there however.  There 
are also 
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/intlaw.html"> International
Legal Materials</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/un.html">
United Nations Resources</A> available.  These research tools are very 
useful for people interested in legal issues.  Unfortunately, the legal 
resources offered by U.S.C. do not include a comprehensive listing of 
judicial decisions.  This can only be obtained by services such as Westlaw
and Lexus that charge for log-on time.  
<p>
The last pioneer law school on the web is 
<A HREF="http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/"> Case Western Reserve Law 
School</A>.  Case Western is a pioneer for a couple of reasons.  First of 
all, it provides a comprehensive list of 
<A HREF="http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/1/internetlibraries"> 
Internet Law Related Libraries.</A>  This may not instantly provide 
information to users, but it provides hypertext links to libraries that 
can.  Another innovation from Case Western is the ability to request <A 
HREF="http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/0h/cwrulaw/form/application.html">
application materials</A> from the law school on-line.  Perhaps the next 
step will be to actually apply to law schools by using the web.  Finally, 
for those interested in international law, Case Western provides a 
<A HREF="http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/0/intlaw/start.html"> Digest of the 
International Law of the United States.</A>  All three of these services 
are interesting and useful to the law student or prospective student.



</ol>
<HR>
Currently, there are only a few law schools that provide extensive access to 
legal knowledge via the world wide web. However, these schools are successful in 
providing a wide range of knowledge and have already established a foundation 
for other law schools to follow.  Eventually, law schools should be able to 
provide a wide range of services for web users.  For instance, prospective 
students could apply to law schools on-line.  Comprehensive judicial decisions 
could be made available for web users free of charge.  Each law school could also 
include law review articles as part of their web page in order to assist web 
users with research.  All of these services will help to expand the usefulness 
of these law school web pages and at the same time increase the importance of 
the world wide web.  Eventually, as the services of the world wide web expand, 
the need for non-electronic information will become greatly diminished.  
Already, we are seeing the tremendous demand for information via the world wide web.
