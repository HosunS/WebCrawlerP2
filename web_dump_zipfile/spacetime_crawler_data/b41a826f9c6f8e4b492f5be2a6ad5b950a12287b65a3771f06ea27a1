<B>Weeks 4 - 6, 31 January - 16 February 1995</B><br>
<em>(Revised 10 February 1995)</em>
<p>
Using 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw2skel.html">
<code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw2skel.html </code></a>
as a basis, create an HTML document with the following content:
<ol>
   <li> Your name, e-mail address and major.
   <li> Three items of interest you have found on the web
      with a brief statement about each including a link
      to the item.
   <li> Five questions that you could not have answered at the
      start of this quarter, that you can answer now along with
      the answers.  Each answer should be at least 80 words long
      and contain at least 2 links to other documents on the Web.
      At least 2 of these 5 questions should be directly related
      to the content of this course and at least 2 others should
      be directly related to your major or (if you are unaffiliated)
      an academic area you are considering as your major.

</ol>
<p>
During labs on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 7 and 8,
submit the five questions in text form, using the HTML form
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw2a.html">
  <code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw2a.html</code></a>
which will be available at that time.
<p>
Submit your final HTML document by noon, Thursday February 16,
by using Mosaic to Mail the HTML form of it to
<code>ics1c@ics.uci.edu</code> with the following ``Subject:'':<br>
<pre>
    HW3 -- First_Name Last_Name -- eaxx1234
</pre>
where ``<code>First_Name Last_Name</code>'' is your name and
``<code>eaxx1234</code>'' is your EA login.
<p>
<B>Reminder:</B> ``Mail to ...'' is a selection under Mosaic's
``File'' button.<br>
<b>Be sure to set</b> the ``Format for mailed document''
to <em>HTML</em>, the ``Subject:'' as specified above, and
the ``Mail To:'' entry to go to <code>ics1c@ics.uci.edu</code>,
<b>before</b> pressing the ``Mail'' button.

<p>
Grading will be on the basis of content and presentation
(including appropriate use of the technology).
Your choice of questions is an important and influential
part of the content.
