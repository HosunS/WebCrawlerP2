<p>
<b>Install Python and Java before installing Eclipse.</b>
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
<p>
This document shows downloading and installing Eclipse (Photon) on Windows 7
  in Summer 2018.
<b>You should download and install the latest version of Eclipse.</b>
The current latest (as of Winter 2019) is Eclipse 2018-12.
<p>
Remember that you must install Java, Python, and Eclipse as all 32-bit or
  all 64-bit.
I recommend using the 32-bit verisons for each.
<p>
<hr align="left" width="100%">


<h2>Eclipse: (Photon)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 320 MB of disk space; keep it on your
  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires an additional 350 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages" target="_blank">
      Eclipse</a><p>
    The following page will appear in your browser.
    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers</b>
      for Windows 32 Bit; if your computer uses Windows, continue below;
      otherwise choose either <b>Mac Cocoa</b> or <b>Linux</b> instead.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/eclipsedownloadpage.jpg">
    <p>
    It is critical that Java, Python, and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are
       all 64 Bit (and the, only if your Machine/OS supports 64 Bit): I think
       it easiest to use 32 Bit for everything.

<p>
<li>Click the <b>32-Bit</b> (after Windows) to the right of the
      <b>Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers</b>; this version may appear on the
      top of the list, or may appear further down.
    <p>
    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
      institution underneath the orange <b>DOWNLOAD</b> button).
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/mirror.jpg">
     
<p>
<li>Click the orange <b>DOWNLOAD</b> button.
    The site named here, beneath the button:
      <b>United States - OSU Opoen Source Lab (http)</b>
      is the random one chosen by the download page this time; yours may differ.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder, while
      showing a splash screen about donating to Eclipse.
    This file is about 320 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 5 minutes over a
      cable modem).
    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
      steady progress.
    In Chrome progress is shown on the bottom-left of the window, via the icon
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/downloadprogress.jpg">
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/downloadfile.jpg">
    <p>
    Terminate the tab browsing this webpage.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<p>
<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing (for Python)</h3>

<b>Python and Java should be installed before installing Eclipse</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-committers-photon-win32.zip</b>, the file that you just
     downloaded and moved.
    <br>
    On my machine (running Windows 7), I can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click the file.
    <li>Hover over the <b>IZArc</b> command from the menu of options.
    <li>Click <b>Extract Here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/izarc.jpg">
    <p>
    If you do not have IZArc or an equivalent unzipping program, here is the
      web site to download a free copy of
      <a href="http://izarc.org/downloads" target="_blank">IZarc</a>.
    <p>

    <p>
    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b>; unzipping
      250 MB can take a few minutes.
    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.
    I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the
       <b>C:\Program Files\</b> directory.

<p>
<li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file in
      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipse/eclipseexe.jpg">
    <br>
    On most Windows machines, you can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>
    <li>Drag it to the desktop.
    <li>Release the right button.
    <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
      your machine.

<p>
<li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.
    <p>
<!---
    If the following <b>Security Warning</b> window appears
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/securitywarning.jpg">
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uncheck the <b>Always ask before opening this file</b> checkbox
      <li>Click <b>Run</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
--->
    The following splash screen will appear
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/splash.jpg">
    <p>
    and then an <b>Eclipse Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/workspacelauncher.jpg">
    <p>
    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your name should appear between
      <b>C:\Users\</b> and <b>\eclipse-workspace</b>, instead of <b>Pattis</b>.
    <p>
    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
      remind you where your workspace is located.
    <p>
    In fact, it is a good idea to create on your desktop a shortcut to your
      workspace folder; but you must click <b>OK</b> (see below) before
      Eclipse creates this folder and you can create a shortcut to it.
    <p>

<li>Click <b>Launch</b>.
    <p>
    If you have an older version of Eclipse installed, the following pop-up
      window will apperar.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/olderworkspaceversion.jpg">
    <p>
    In this pop-up window appears, click <b>Continue</b> to update the
      workspace for the newer version of Eclipse.
    <p>
    Progress bars will appear as Eclipse loads.
    <p>
    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
      covering it.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/welcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.
    <p>
    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse again, after
      this first time.

<p>
<li>Click <b>Help</b> (on the far right of the line below this window's blue
      title <b>eclipse-workspace - Eclipse</b>) and then click
      <b>Install New Software...</b> in its pull-down menu, as shown below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/installnewsoftware.jpg">
    <p>
    The <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/install.jpg">

<p>
<li>Enter the text (or cut/paste from this document)
      <b>http://pydev.org/updates</b> into the <b>Work with</b> text box and
      press <b>Enter</b> (if that doesn't work, try
      <b>http://www.pydev.org/updates</b>).
    <p>
    In a few seconds the information under <b>Name</b> should change from<br>
    <b>There is no site selected</b> to <b>Pending</b> to

    <p>
    Select only the top <b>PyDev</b> checkbox; do <b>NOT</b> select the 
      <b>PyDev Mylyn Integration (optional)</b> box.<br>
    Check before proceeding that the <b>Install</b> pop-up window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/installdone.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Next &gt;</b>
    <p>
    A new <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/review.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Next &gt;</b>
    <p>
    A new <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    Select the <b>I accept the terms of the license agreement</b> radio button,
      so the window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/reviewlicense.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Finish</b>
    <p>
    The lower right-hand corner of the <b>eclipse-workspace - Eclipse</b>
      window will show the various operations it is performing and a progress
      bar for each one.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/installingsoftwareprogress.jpg">
    <p>
    Because the installer is fetching various files online, this process might
      take a few minutes.
    <p>
    If you see a <b>Security Warning</b> pop-up window
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/securitywarning2.jpg">
    <p>
    Click <b>Install anyway</b>.
    <p>
    The installation will finish (the progress bar will disappear).
    <p>
    A <b>Software Updates</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/restart.jpg">

<!---
    <p>
    The installation will pause, and  a <b>Selection Needed</b> pop-up window
      appears.
<p>
<li>Check the box labeled <b>Brainwy Software; Pydev; Brainwy</b>.
    <p>
    Check before proceeding that the <b>Install</b> pop-up window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/selection.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>OK</b>
    <p>
    The installation will finish (showing the final progress bars).
    <p>
    A <b>Software Updates</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsephoton/restart.jpg">

      file into this workspace and unzip it there, producing the
      <b>courselib</b> folder; it should should contain a bunch of Python
      module files (ending in <b>.py</b>).
    From time to time you may be asked to put other course-specific Python
      module files into this <b>courselib</b> folder; these modules will be
