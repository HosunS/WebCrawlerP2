<TD VALIGN="top"><B>&#149; E-mail Notices on the Faculty Advising Process</B>
<P>
Your official UCI email serves as the <B>only</B> communication path from the 
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering regarding the mandatory Faculty 
Advising Process, as well as other program matters. You are solely responsible 
for regularly checking your UCI email and responding as appropriate. No other

<A NAME="Why"></A>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 BORDER=0 WIDTH=800 ALIGN=center BGCOLOR="#eeeeee">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=top"><B>&#149; Why Do We Have Faculty Advising for Undergraduates?</B>
<P>
The simple answer is that annual faculty advising of undergraduate students is 
required for engineering degree program accreditation; a degree from an accredited 
engineering program is required to qualify for professional registration; and 
professional registration is required for engineering practice. The advising process, 
however, exists for many practical reasons. Our program requirements evolve thus 
regular meetings with students are the best way to provide information on current 
programs and planned changes. In this regard, faculty advising complements but 
does not replace annual meetings with Samueli School of Engineering (HSSOE)  
<A HREF="#REC305">counselors</A> to develop a 
<A HREF="#PlanOS">Plan of Study</A>. 
The faculty advising process also provides an opportunity for students to discuss 
a broad range of issues with program faculty, whether involving degree issues, 
specialization choices, career opportunities, or even professional practice. It 
provides a good deal of potential opportunity at a very low cost.</P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 BORDER=0 WIDTH=800 ALIGN=center>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=top"><BR><B>&#149; What Is the CEE Faculty Advising Process?</B>
<P>
Many academic programs assign freshmen to advisors, faculty who will remain in 
that capacity as the student proceeds through the program. This fixed reference 
point is a benefit to many students who have questions throughout the year. We 
have chosen to assign freshmen to a <B>group of faculty advisors</B>, providing a 
fixed group of advisors for the same group of students over the entire time that 
they are in the degree program. Each advising cohort has a faculty member from each 
research area (structures, transportation, and environmental or water). Your faculty 
advisors will <I>continue to advise you as long as you are in our UG programs</I>.</P>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=top"><B>&#149; When Is CEE Faculty Advising for Undergraduates?</B>
<P>
The faculty advising process is mandatory for all undergraduate students in the 
Samueli School of Engineering's Department Civil and Environmental Engineering 
(CEE). Faculty advising involves meeting with a <B>faculty member</B> in group 
and/or individual advising sessions. Faculty advising is in <I>addition</I> to 
the advising you receive from Samueli School of Engineering undergraduate 
<A HREF="#REC305">counselors</A>.</P>
<P>
The formal process for <B>sophomores</B>, <B>juniors</B>, and <B>seniors</B> 
usually begins in the <B>winter quarter</B>, although students are encouraged 
to see a faculty advisor at any time. A schedule will be announced prior to the 
quarter as to when the group sessions will be scheduled (see below). Individual 
sessions, as an option to group sessions, must be individually scheduled directly 
with a faculty member from your advising cohort.</P>
<P>
To avoid missing communications with the department regarding advising or other 
matters, always <B>check your official UCI e-mail regularly</B>. This is the best 
way for us to effectively communicate with our students.</P>
<P>
<B>Freshmen and Transfers:</B> Please note that the advising process for 
freshmen and transfers will begin in the <B>fall quarter</B>. Please review the 
Freshmen <A HREF="http://www.its.uci.edu/~mmcnally/FAQ-Fresh-advising.html">FAQs</A>. 
Transfer students who have completed their freshman year should also join the 
winter advising process corresponding to their year in their degree program.</P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 BORDER=0 WIDTH=800 ALIGN=center>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=top"><BR><B>&#149; How Does the CEE Faculty Advising Process Work?</B>
<P>
There are two components to the process: group advising and individual advising:</P>
<P> 
<B>Group Advising</B> provides students an overview of campus, school, department, 
and degree program policies, programs, and opportunities. Sessions will include a 
summary of the degree programs, an overview of the ABET accreditation process, and 
information on academic honesty, research and professional opportunities, graduate 
school, and achieving professional engineering registration. Group sessions are of 
particular importance for freshmen and transfers, or for any student not following 
the typical plan of study or meeting annually with an HSSOE counselor.</P>
<P>
A special session providing an <B>Overview of Environmental Engineering</B> is often 
scheduled with group sessions to provide more detailed information on the BSEnE major. 
This session is optional but may be of interest to BSCE and BSEnE majors, particularly 
those early in their programs.</P>
<P>
<B>Individual Advising</B> sessions provide each student the opportunity to meet 
with a CEE faculty member to discuss career paths, research opportunities, and a 
variety of other topics related to civil and environmental engineering. Individual 
sessions are often more useful than group sessions for sophomores, juniors, and 
seniors. Each student <B>must</B> meet with an advisor at least once each year, in 
either a <I>group session or individual appointment</I>, otherwise, a hold will be 
placed on your registration for the next fall quarter (see below).</P>

Faculty Advisors?</B>
<P>
Your cohort of faculty advisors is determined by your year in our academic programs. 
There are different faculty cohorts for "Freshmen", "Sophomores", and "Juniors", and 
"Seniors".</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Freshmen</B> include students taking typical freshmen classes, primarily first 
year math and science courses and CEE81A, regardless of the total number of UCI credit 
hours completed to date. Freshmen are planning to take sophomore courses in the next 
academic year. If you are a freshman, please see 
<A HREF="http://www.its.uci.edu/~mmcnally/FAQ-Fresh-advising.html">FAQs</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sophomores</B> include students taking typical sophomore classes, including 
second year math courses as well as courses such as CEE30, 20, 11, 81B, and 21, 
regardless of the total number of UCI credit hours completed. Sophomores are planning 
to take junior courses in the next academic year. You will be part of the <B>winter 
quarter</B> advising process and will attend a group session designated for "Sophomores".<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Juniors</B> include CE students taking courses such as CEE121, 150, 170, 
130, 151A, 171, and 110, and EnE students taking courses such as 150, 170, 130, 110, 
160, and 162. You are planning to take senior courses in the next academic year. 
You will be part of the <B>winter</B> quarter advising process and must attend a 
group session designated for "Juniors".<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Seniors</B> include students who are taking the CEE181 Senior Design 
course sequence as well as specialization and engineering electives. Seniors who are 
graduating at the end of the current academic year are not required to complete the 
formal advising process. However, if you are planning to take any courses to fulfill 
degree requirements in the next academic year, then you must complete the advising 
process this year. There is no formal group advising process for seniors; only the 
individual advising process must be fulfilled. You must contact one of your faculty 
advisors and schedule a meeting.<BR>
</OL>
<P>
It is recommended that <B>transfer students</B> (from outside of UCI or from other 
UCI degree programs) attend a freshmen group session in the fall quarter of their first 
year in the program and then complete the appropriate Sophomore, Junior, or Senior 
requirements in the winter and in subsequent years.</P>
