<h1>Java Download and Installation Instructions</h1>

You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Java.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
<p>
This document shows downloading and installing Java 8 update 144 on Windows 7
  in Summer 2017.
<b>You should download and install the latest version of Java.</b>
The current latest (as of Winter 2019) is Javal 8 update 191. 
<p>
Remember that you must install Java, Python, and Eclipse as all 32-bit or
  all 64-bit.
I recommend using the 32-bit verisons for each.
<p>
<hr align="left" width="100%">

<h2>Java</h2><p>

The following instructions were composed for installing Sun Java 1.8.0_144
  (aka Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8, Update 144).
<b>The version you download may be newer.</b>
The current is Version 8 Update 144.
<p>
The Java download requires about 56 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to reinstall Java.
When installed, Java requires about an additional 160 MB of disk space.
<p>
You need to install Java, Python, and Eclipse, all verision muyst be 32-bit or
  all versions must be 64-bit.
I have used 32-bit versions in all my web pages and I suggest that you do too.

<!--- 64 bit?

<p>
<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Double click the <b>jre-8u144-windows-i586.exe</b>
      file that you just downloaded and moved.
    <p>
    In a few seconds a pop-up window titled <b>User Account Control</b> will
      appear, posing the question <b>Do you want the following program to
      install software on this computer?</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/useraccountcontrol.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Yes</b> button.
    <p>
    A <b>Java Setup - Welcome</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupwelcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Install &gt;</b> button.
    <p>
    A <b>Java Setup - Progress</b> pop-up window will appear, with the 
      following message at the top of the window:
        <b>Status: Installing Java</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupprogress.jpg">
    <p>
    A green progress bar will appear, showing the progress as it installs
     Java, and will finally disappear (on my machine this took about
     30 seconds).
    <p>
    <ul>
      If an <b>Java Setup - Uninstall out-of-date versions</b> pop-up window
        appears
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/uninstall.jpg">
    <p>
    Click the <b>Uninstall &gt;</b> button; if you are
        concerned that other software you have may need an older verison of
        Java, click the <b>Remind me Later</b>.
    You may want to click the <b>More information</b> link, which recommends
      uninstalling older versions of Java.
    <p>
    I unsintalled two out-of-date versions, and the following
      <b>Java Setup - Complete</b> pop-up window appeared.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/uninstallcomplete.jpg">
    <p>
    I Clicked <b>Next</b>.
    
    </ul>
    <p>
    Eventually, a <b>Java Setup - Complete</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupcomplete.jpg">
    <p>

<p>
<li>Click <b>Close</b>.
    <p>
    A browser will appear, with a red <b>Verify Java version</b> button.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/verifyversion.jpg">

<p>
<li>Because of recent incompatabilities between Java and browsers, this test
      will typically not run correctly, so just terminate this browser.
    <p>
    If you know how to bring up system prompt/cmd window, you can test the Java
      installation by typing <b>java -version</b> to the prompt and pressing
      the <b>Enter</b> key.
    It should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/javatest.jpg">
    <p>
    After seeing this message (look for <b>java version "1.8.0_144"</b> on the
      line after the command) or an error message, type <b>exit</b> in the
      <b>cmd.exe</b> window and press the <b>Enter</b> key.

</ol>
The installed files are typically stored (in Windows) in the folder
  <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java</b>.
Inside this folder should be the folder: <b>jre1.8.0_144</b>, which itself
  should contain a <b>bin</b> and <b>lib</b> folder, and some miscellaneous
  <b>.txt</b> and a <b>Welcome.html</b> file.
<p>
You may now follow the instructions to download and install Python and then
  the Eclipse IDE.
