All students consented to this data<br>#  being shared for research purposes provided no uniquely identifiable<br>#  information was contained in the distributed files.  The information<br>#  was collected through various means, with emphasis being placed on<br>#  the collection of objective, quantifiable information.  For more<br>#  information on the data collection procedures, please see the paper<br>#  referenced above.<br>#<br>#<br>#  PRIVACY<br>#  -------<br>#  The data contained in this file does not contain any information<br>#  which may be individually traced to a particular student who<br>#  participated in the study.<br>#<br>#<br>#  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES AND DERIVATIONS<br>#  -------------------------------------------------<br>#  SAMs (Student Activity Measure) are collected for each student team<br>#  member during their participation in a software engineering class.<br>#  Student teams work together on a final class project, and comprise<br>#  5-6 students.  Teams that are made up of students from only one<br>#  school are labeled local teams.  Teams made up of students from more<br>#  than one school are labeled global teams.  SAMs are collected from:<br>#  weekly timecards, instructor observations, and software engineering<br>#  tool usage logs.  SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval<br>#  (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure).  Outcomes are<br>#  determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student<br>#  team work in two categories:  software engineering process (how well<br>#  the team applied best software engineering practices), and software<br>#  engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team<br>#  produced).  Thus for each team, two outcomes are determined, process<br>#  and product, respectively.  Outcomes are classified into two class<br>#  grades, A or F.  A represents teams that are at or above<br>#  expectations, F represents teams that are below expectations or need<br>#  attention.  For more information, please see the paper referenced<br>#  above.<br>#<br>#  The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes<br>#  and are to be considered separately, e.g. one should train ML for SE<br>#  process separately from training for SE product.<br>#<br>#  TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED<br>#  ------------------------------------------<br>#  Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated<br>#  into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting<br>#  different dynamics of teamwork during the class.  Time intervals<br>#  represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each<br>#  team.  A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class<br>#  for all student teams.  The milestones are roughly divided into the<br>#  following topics:<br>#<br>#            M1 - high level requirements and specs<br>#            M2 - more detailed requirements and specs<br>#            M3 - first prototype<br>#            M4 - beta release<br>#            M5 - final delivery<br>#<br>#  Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are<br>#  being produced.  Time intervals are used in research only.<br>#<br>#  In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones, a number<br>#  of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been<br>#  calculated.  This was done to group student activities into design<br>#  vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.<br>#<br>#  These time intervals are defined as follows:<br>#<br>#      Time Interval        Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class<br>#    -----------------    --------------------------------------------<br>#           0               Milestone 0<br>#           1               Milestone 1<br>#           2               Milestone 2<br>#           3               Milestone 3<br>#           4               Milestone 4<br>#           5               Milestone 5<br>#           6               Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive<br>#           7               Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive<br>#           8               Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive<br>#           9               Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive<br>#          10               Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive<br>#          11               Milestone 3 - Milestone 5 inclusive<br>#<br>#<br>#<br>#  SETAP PROJECT OVERALL DATA STATISTICS<br>#  ================================================================== <br>#  The following is a set of statistics about the entire dataset which<br>#  may be useful in the configuration of machine learning methods.<br>#<br>#  This data was collected only from students at SFSU.

By using this systematic approach, TAM feature names are<br>#  produced that are human understandable and intuitive and related to<br>#  aggregation method.<br>#<br>#<br>#  There are a number of base TAM which are then aggregated into<br>#  aggregated TAM.<br>#<br>#  BASE TAM<br>#  --------<br>#<br>#  General TAM<br>#  -----------<br>#  The following TAMs are collected for each team: Year, semester,<br>#  timeInterval, teamNumber, semesterId, teamMemberCount,<br>#  femaleTeamMembersPercent, teamLeadGender, teamDistribution<br>#<br>#  Calculated TAM<br>#  --------------<br>#  For each team, TAM were calculated from SAMs for every time interval<br>#  Ti.  The core TAM variables where for each we compute as applicable:<br>#  count, average, standard deviation over weeks, over students etc.<br>#<br>#  TAMs collected by Weekly Time Cards (WTS) TAM<br>#  ---------------------------------------------<br>#  teamMemberResponseCount, meetingHours, inPersonMeetingHours.<br>#  nonCodingDeliverablesHours, codingDeliverablesHours, helpHours,<br>#  globalLeadAdminHours, LeadAdminHoursResponseCount,<br>#  GlobalLeadAdminHoursResponseCount<br>#<br>#  TAMs collected  by Tool Logs (TL) TAM<br>#  -------------------------------------<br>#  commitCount, uniqueCommitMessageCount, uniqueCommitMessagePercent,<br>#  CommitMessageLength<br>#<br>#  Collected by Instructor Observations (IO) TAMs<br>#  ------------------------------------------------<br>#  issueCount, onTimeIssueCount, lateIssueCount<br>#<br>#<br>#  AGGREGATED TAM<br>#  --------------<br>#<br>#  Several aggregation method and derived variable names for TAMs<br>#  reflect how the core TAM variables were aggregated in final TAM<br>#  measures for each time interval Ti:<br>#<br>#  Let VAR be the core TAM variable above. The naming conventions and<br>#  aggregation operators to obtain TAMs for each time interval Ti were<br>#  as follows:<br>#<br>#  <VAR>Total - total sum of VAR in the time interval Ti<br>#  <VAR>Average - average of VAR in the time interval<br>#  <VAR>StandardDeviation - SD of variable in time interval<br>#  <VAR>Count - count of events measured by VAR (e.g. missed<br>#  checkpoints) in time interval<br>#  Average<VAR>ByWeek - total sum/count of VAR in the time interval<br>#  divided by weeks in time interval<br>#  StandradDeviation<VAR>ByWeek - the standard devation of the weekly<br>#  total of VAR taken over the time interval<br>#  Average<VAR>ByStudent - total count/sum of VAR in time interval,<br>#  divided by number of students in the team<br>#  StandardDeviation <VAR>ByStudent - standard deviation of  VAR in the<br>#  time interval, over students in the team<br>#<br>#<br>#  NULL VALUES<br>#  -----------<br>#  NULL values are used in the training data to indicate that no SAMs<br>#  were recorded in that particular time period, week, or for that<br>#  student.<br>#<br>#  Frequently TAM features involving teamLeadHours or globalTeamLead<br>#  hours will result in a NULL for a particular training sample.  For<br>#  local team leads, that usually means that the local team lead did<br>#  not complete any timecard surveys for the aggregation in quesiton.<br>#  While for global team lead TAM features this may also be the case,<br>#  the more usual cause of NULLS in global team lead TAM features comes<br>#  from the fact that most teams are not global, and therefore this<br>#  statistic was not gathered for these teams.<br>#<br>#  It is left to the individual researcher to decide how to accomodate<br>#  NULL values, and the data is included in this file.  Though these<br>#  may not be useful for machine learning directly, valuable<br>#  information can be obatined with some processing.<br>#<br>#  TAM FEATURES<br>#  ------------<br>#  The following is a list of tam features available in the data files.<br>#  The TAM feature names are listed in the order in which the data<br>#  appear in each training sample, i.e. the first feature corresponds<br>#  to the first column, the second feature corresponds to the second<br>#  column, etc.<br>#<br>#  The first sample line in the data section of the data file is not a<br>#  true sample, but consists of TAM feature names, which allows for<br>#  easy import into spreadsheets and for human readability.<br>#<br>#  The final two TAM features (columns) are the outcome data for<br>#  process and product, and are the last two columns in each sample<br>#  row.  The training sample data follow the header comment section.<br>#<br>#<br>#  TAM FEATURE LIST<br>#  ----------------<br>#  year<br>#  semester<br>#  timeInterval<br>#  teamNumber<br>#
