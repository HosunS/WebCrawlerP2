<P>Iï¿½m going to talk about three broad areas today. First, Iï¿½ll give a review of collaborative authoring scenarios and features in the word processing arena. Right now the leading workgroup word processors have a fairly rich feature set for collaborative authoring thatï¿½s quite unmatched by anything in the Web authoring area. At first thought that might seem to give us some short-term advantage in a battle over file formats. But what we really want to do is take what weï¿½ve already learned through years of studying users in workgroup scenarios, and apply that to the Web. For examples, Iï¿½ll focus on Word 7.0, which actually has the same collaborative authoring feature set as Word 6.0. Just to be fair, though, Iï¿½ll mention some interesting work that Lotus has done on Word Pro 96.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Second, Iï¿½ll give a very high-level overview of Wordï¿½s future plans in collaborative authoring. Unfortunately I canï¿½t give you too many specifics about Word 8, which is coming out this fall. But Iï¿½ll try to tell you what I can.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Next, Iï¿½ll talk about some of the issues weï¿½ll need to answer in order to have a collaborative authoring Web feature set based on open standards.</P>
