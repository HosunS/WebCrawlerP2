I never had an original letter.  A friend had a book about Jews in a small
portion of upstate NY in connection with her own family history.  She knew of
my interest in Langsams and pointed out the section.  I created a mini family
tree from the book's description.  Years later, in 1997, actually, I had a
letter from Martin Langsam, 6400 Mill Pointe Circle, Delray Beach, FL 33484 and
we carried on a minor correspondence.  He said he was the son of Jack and
Tessie Langsam from H20.  He was also related on his mother's side to H63 but I
could never get him to tell him how that relationship worked. I called him and
got very little from him.  He said that his father, Jack, was born in 1892 in
Austria.  His grandfather was Aaron or Aron.  Rose Kopita was his great aunt,
his grandfather's sister.  Aron's gravestone says that her father was Zvi
Elimelech.  Aron's wife was Etta Stecker. It was Etta who was somehow related
to H63.


Rose and Abe Kopita had a son Frank who lived in California in 1997.  He had 3
sons, but Martin didn't know their whereabouts.  Rose and Abe were married in
NYC before moving to Tupper Lake.  I never tried to find their marriage record.


Rose is probably buried in Ogdensburg.


I will make you a copy of Martin's longest letter which may help a bit more.

Hi,

Thanks for your inquiry. Regarding the names that you mention, I know them but 
am not affiliated with them. When they were doing research they did not know of 
me. I am guessing you have some interest in 
offspring of Pesach Langsam (1748 - 1820). 

Have you seen my website at 
www.langsam.com

I have much more information than is presented there. Can you tell me a little 
about the family you are interested in exploring?

I have had a moderate amount of success with this type of situation. What page 
are you on in the book?  What were your grandparent's names and is his Rose 
referenced in another section of the book?

Hi,

In the interim, can you tell me a few things? Have you obtained Aaron's death 
certificate? Naturalization Record? Ship Record? How old was Aaron? I am 
guessing that the TWO attached ship records are your family. If so, we 
already know a lot, like they came from Lancut, Galicia. Aaron came to his 
uncle. He was born 1867. There is a naturalization record listed by his 
children, so we should try to locate it. Have you looked for Aaron in the 
1900 census in NY? Maybe it lists him with this uncle (he came in 1899).

Any other Langsam's buried near Aaron? There are quite a few Langsam's at Mt. 
Hebron. 

With that said, the basic approach is to go up another branch when you hit a 
deadend.So, did your grandfather have any known siblings? Did you father ever 
speak of aunts, uncles, or cousins? From your father's other siblings, were 
there any children? If so, have you contacted all of them? I can be of assistance 
in that area if you prefer.

Hi,

That is the address that I refer to. The email I sent to them "bounced". How long ago 
did they contact you? 

Also, I received your photos. Thanks! I now have a theory. To prove it, I need Aaron's 
mother's name. Do you have it? If not, can you call Mt. Hebron before we talk and see 
if they have it?

Speak you you at 1pm tomorrow.

Subject: H20 = L5.0.2

Dear Suzan, Yedidya, and Michael,

Briefly, I was in contact with Martin Langsam of Florida. Based on our conversation 
I checked the EIDB. He also mailed me a tombstone picture of Aaron's (in Hebrew). 
With that I went to NY Vital Records (Chambers St). Based on the tombstone and death 
record, his Aaron is the same Aaron listed in L5.0.2

Points: Aaron was from Lancut, as per EIDB (see attachment),
The tombstone says his father was Hersh Mylech
He was 71 in 1937, the age fits the other children
L5.0.2 says that Aaron came to the USA
His death record says Aaron's mother was Beila.

-Moishe

PS: I have downloaded ALL the Langsam references in the EIDB that I could find. For 
those interested, I have a spreadsheet and the corresponding .gif files (total 21 mb).
