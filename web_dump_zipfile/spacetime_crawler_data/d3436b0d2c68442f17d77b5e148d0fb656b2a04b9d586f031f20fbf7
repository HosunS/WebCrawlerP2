<h1> Rollercoasters and Caterpillars
</h1>
<h2>Jordan Jorgensen, UCI</h2> 
<p>
A rollercoaster is a sequence of real numbers for which every maximal
contiguous subsequence, that is increasing or decreasing, has length at least
three. By translating this sequence to a set of points in the plane, a
rollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal
sub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.
Given a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for
a maximum-length (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence that is a
rollercoaster. It was conjectured that every sequence of n distinct real
numbers contains a rollercoaster of length at least n/2 for n > 7, while the
best known lower bound is â„¦(n/ log n). In this paper we prove this
conjecture. Our proof is constructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for
computing a rollercoaster of this length. Extending the O(n log n)-time
algorithm for computing a longest increasing subsequence, we show how to
compute a maximum-length rollercoaster within the same time bound. A
maximumlength rollercoaster in a permutation of {1, . . . , n} can be
computed in O(n log log n) time. 
The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set
embedding of caterpillars. A caterpillar is a tree such that deleting the
leaves gives a path, called the spine. A top-view caterpillar is one of
degree 4 such that the two leaves adjacent to each vertex lie on opposite
sides of the spine. As an application of our result on rollercoasters, we are
able to find a planar drawing of every n-node top-view caterpillar on every
set of (25/3)*n points in the plane, such that each edge is an orthogonal
path with one bend. This improves the previous best known upper bound on the
number of required points, which is O(n log n). We also show that such a
drawing can be obtained in linear time, provided that the points are given in
sorted order.
