Descendants of Yeshaya David SPIRA


Generation No. 1

1.  YESHAYA DAVID4 SPIRA  (MESHULUM ZISHE BEN ZVI ELIMELECH3, ZVI ELIMELECH OF DINOV ('BNEI 
YISSASCHAR')2, PESACH1 LANGSAM) died Bef. 1906.  He married RIVKA FRIMET.  She died Bef. 1895.

Notes for YESHAYA DAVID SPIRA:
Grandson of Zvi Elimelech of Dinov, the 'Bnei Yissaschar'.  Yeshaya David Spira and his wife Rivka Frimet 
had one son and six daughters.  Four of the daughters lived in Sendziszow ('Sendeshov') and two in 
Dembica.  The children of their son Yitzchok Yehuda lived in Wielopole (Vielipoli) and Jedlicze (Yedlitch) 
These towns are all located within 50 km (30 miles) of each other.  The nearest larger towns, Reisha 
(Rzeszow) and Krosno, are about midway between Krakow and Lvov (Lemberg), and are also not far from 
Dinov and Blusiv.  Apparently, Yeshaya David's father Meshulum Zishe died young, while his father the 
Rebbe was still alive.  Young Yeshaya David was raised in the home of the Rebbe.

Notes for RIVKA FRIMET:
The families of Yeshaya David Spira and Rivka Frimet were nearly decimated by the Shoah (Holocaust).  
Four of their daughters (Chana Mindel, Dreyzil, Nechama Yita and Layah) were apparently murdered by the 
Nazis when they were elderly (in their 70's) as were many of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  
Only one child of Yeshaya David and Rivka Frimet, Sima Spira and her husband Pinchas Schein, had 
earlier migrated from Europe to the US (abt. 1906).  The circumstances leading to that emigration are not 
known.  Miraculously, four of the six siblings of Sima who remained in Europe had at least one grandchild 
who survived the Holocaust.  These European-born great grandchildren of Yeshaya David and Rivka Frimet, 
and their descendents, are alive today and thriving in the US and in Israel, and have contributed significantly 
to the information about their branches of this family tree.
	
Children of YESHAYA SPIRA and RIVKA are:
2.	i.	CHANA MINDEL5 SPIRA, d. Holocaust.
3.	ii.	DREYZIL SPIRA, d. Holocaust.

Notes for NECHAMA YITA SPIRA:

when the Nazis killed the elderly Jews in 1942.


	iv.	LAYAH SPIRA, d. died in Holocaust; m. MR. ANKER.

Notes for LAYAH SPIRA:
Lived in Sendziszow, had one son and three daughters:  Malcha, Ruchcha, Chana, all of whom perished 
in the Holocaust.  The married name of one of her daughters was Neybenzahl (lived near Krakow).

Layah Spira was most likely related to Chaim Anker of Chicago, who was known to several members of 
Sima Spira's family in America.  Dave Schein mentioned that Chaim Anker had no children.  Whether 
Chaim Anker was Layah (Anker) Spira's son, or whether he was a relative of Layah Spira's husband, is 
not known.

ELIMELECH OF DINOV ('BNEI YISSASCHAR')2, PESACH1 LANGSAM) was born Abt. 1870, and died June 21, 1952

SCHEIN and MIRIAM.  He was born Abt. 1872, and died October 17, 1938 in Beth Israel Hospital, New 
York.

Notes for SIMA ('SYME') BAS YESHAYA DAVID SPIRA:
Sima emigrated from Sendziszow, Poland to the New York, probably in 1906.  Probably she was the 
youngest child in her family.  

According to her daughter Leah (Marcus) Schein, Sima had a photo made (by Chaim Anker??) of her entire 
immediate family around 1920, when Leah was age 8.  Excluded from the photo were daughter 
Fannie/Dreyzil and husband Pinchas (who didn't allow himself to be photographed).  The whereabouts of 
such a Schein family photo, or copies of it, are not known.

According to Leah (Marcus) Schein, Sima kept on touch by mail with her siblings in Europe, in particular 
Leibish (Yitzchok Yehuda), Dreyzil and Chuma (Nechama Yita).  Leah often went to the post office to mail 
letters to them.  Leah her mother Sima told her that Nechama Yita was a very pretty woman who married 
three times but had no children (confirmed by Tovia Spira).  Because of this, Sima was concerned that if her 
daughters didn't have children during the first year of marriage, they might be barren like their Aunt 
Nechama.

Sima is buried in a family plot at Beth David Cemetary, Elmont, LI, NY.  Also buried there are Pinchas 
Schein and children Miriam, Shlomo and Fannie/Dreyzil (location AA2, off of 'Emanuel Avenue').

Notes for PINCHAS BEN YEHUDA SCHEIN:
First in family to emigrate to the US. May have made one or more trip(s) back to Europe.  Sima and 
daughters Chana Mindel, Miriam and Rosalie came after Pinchas' original emigration, apparently in 1906 
(1903?).  Later (in 1910) came children Shlomo and Tessy, 'with a family friend who posed as their 
grandfather', according to both Leah Marcus and Tessy Costello.  Pinchas Schein had to certify that his son 
Shlomo (who was ill) would not become a ward of the state.  Pinchas owned a house at 83 Sherrif Street, 
Brooklyn, NY, with a store downstairs.  Profession:  Tailor.  Made 'Alpaca' suits for rabbis.  He once made 
a suit for Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt.  Burial:  Beth David Cemetary, Elmont, LI, NY.
