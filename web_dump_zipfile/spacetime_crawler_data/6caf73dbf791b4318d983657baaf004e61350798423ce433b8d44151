  <h3> Short Bio </h3>
  <p>

  Ian G. Harris is Professor of Computer Science at the University of
  California Irvine. He received his BS degree in Computer Science
  from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990. He received his
  MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of
  California San Diego in 1992 and 1997 respectively. He was a member
  of the faculty in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
  at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1997 until June
  2003.
  </p>
  
  <h3> Research Areas </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Functional Verification </li>
    <li> Electronic Design Automation from Natural Language </li>
    <li> Embedded Systems Security </li>
    <li> Social Engineering Attack Detection </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Research projects in Professor Harris' group is related to
  testing of hardware and software systems. His field of interest includes
  validation of hardware systems to ensure that the behavior of the
  system matches the intentions of the designer. He also investigates
  the application of testing for computer security. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a prominent theme in Professor Harris' work in both security and verification. NLP techniques are used to extract information from hardware specifications, and NLP techniques are used to identify social engineering attacks in a dialog between two speakers.

  </p>

  <h3> Service </h3>
  
  <p>
 Professor Harris serves on the program committees of several leading
 conferences in hardware design verification and security including
 IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference, IEEE International Conference
 on Computer-Aided Design, and IEEE Hardware Oriented Security and
 Trust (HOST).
