<h3>Checkin Link (see Recording Attendance below)</h3>
Click the 
<!--<a href="https://checkin.ics.uci.edu" target="_new">Checkin<a>-->
<a href="https://checkin.ics.uci.edu/index.php?tid=309" target="_new">Checkin<a>
link when you are told the appropriate word in class.<br>
If you cannot check in, see Hadar (PSLH 100) or Rich (BSC3 1200)<br>
right after class.<br></br>
The checkin class will show BS3 1200, but that works for <br>
all ICS-90 students, regardless of in which class you sit.<br><br>
Please enable the ability for checkin to know the location<br>
of your device: checkins without locations are suspect<br>


<p>


<h3>Instructors</h3>

<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/">Rich Pattis<a>
  (<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">pattis@ics.uci.edu</a>)<br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/">Hadar Ziv<a>&nbsp;
  (<a href="mailto:ziv@uci.edu">ziv@uci.edu</a>)<br>
<p>

<p>
<h3>Course Goals and Plans</h3>
The three main goals of ICS 90 are to help new students make a successful<br>
transition to UCI, to build a sense of community in ICS, and to introduce <br>
new undergrads to the school, some of the faculty, the majors we offer,<br>
and the work we do.
<p>
In a typical class session, two faculty members will speak for half an hour<br>
each, about their work and background; Rich and Hadar will then also spend<br>
a half hour addressing more general issues about college life, the field of<br>
computing, and strategies for success in ICS.


<p>
<h3>Student Expectations</h3>

ICS 90 is a one-unit course graded Pass/Not Pass. We have designed it <br>
not to require work outside of the class meetings, but we do expect every<br>
student to attend every class. If you cannot attend a class for any reason,<br>
send an email explanation to
<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">Rich Pattis</a>
before class, as early as possible.<br>
Your <b>subject</b> line should include your name (last, first) and the date you<br>
cannot attend: e.g. <b>Anteater, Peter 10-17</b> (for October 17th). Some<br>
absences -with documentation- are excusable; others not.
<p> It's in class where the learning happens, so you should be present. Before<br>
the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we<br>
will record attendance electronically.
<p>
For issues that come up between class meetings, we have set up a forum at<br>
piazza.com.
<a href="https://piazza.com/uci/fall2018/ics90">Sign yourself up</a> and then
<a href="https://piazza.com/uci/fall2018/ics90/home">participate</a> by posting
<!--<a href="http://piazza.com/uci/fall2018/ics90?token=kTCXs1SBTwR">participate</a> by posting-->
questions or<br>
supplying answers. You may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class<br>
for polls and surveys.
<p>You may bring your phone, tablet, or laptop for attendance-taking and for<br>
using Piazza, but do not use it for other purposes, unless asked by the speaker.<br>
After you check in, please turn off your devices and put them away: it is<br>
impolite to the speaker, distractive to surrounding students, and you will<br>
absorb less of the lecture. Students overestimate their ability to multitask.<br>
Put away all electronic devices in class.
<p>

<h3>Seating: Two Classrooms
</h3>
ICS 90 meets in two rooms at the same time:  BS3 1200 and PSLH 100.<br>
You are officially enrolled in one lecture or the other, but <b>ignore which<br>
room you're enrolled in</b> and instead sit in the following room:
<p>
* If your class level is <b>FR</b> or <b>SO</b>, sit in BS3 1200<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;  (attending  6:30pm to 7:50pm).<br><br>
* If your class level is <b>JR</b> or <b>SR</b>, you will be directed (in an<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; upcoming email) to sit in either BS3 1200 (some students)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; or PSLH 100 (most students), attending 6:30pm to 7:30pm.<br>
<p>
You should NOT try to re-register for the room you will sit in!
<p>
This is your official "class level" as shown on WebReg at UCI.
<p>
We will email everyone the official name/class level/room bindings<br>
at the beginning of the week school starts. Both rooms are filled, so<br>
students must sit in their assigned room.

<p>
Most weeks, one faculty member will speak starting at 6:30pm and another<br>
will speak starting at 7:00pm. All students are required to be present for<br>
these talks. The last 20 minutes of each week's class will be devoted to<br>
broader information about college-level work and ICS. This material<br>
is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class<br>
level is <b>FR</b> or <b>SO</b>. We will have these discussions in BS3 1200
  only.<br>
Upper division students (<b>JR</b> and <b>SR</b>) are welcome to attend this last 20<br>
minutes (the room is just a few minutes walk away), but they may also<br>
choose to skip it (we expect almost all will skip it).
<p>

<h3>Recording Attendance
</h3>
Bring a phone, tablet, laptop, smart device to class that allows web browsing.
<p>
During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to the ICS-90 Checkin page<br>
and record that you are attending class by following the Checkin link at the<br>
top of this web page. There you will see a message with instructions about<br>
how to continue. There, you will enter a special word that we will announce<br>
in class. On some days there might be multiple checkin words; to be counted as<br>
present, you are expected to checkin with all words within 15 minutes of when<br>
we announce them.
<p>
It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this App and then leave<br>
class early, unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission<br>
beforehand with Rich Pattis. Likewise, you cannot check in remotely, or<br>
check in for other students. But you may allow present students to use<br>
your device to run the Checkin App.
