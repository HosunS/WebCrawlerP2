<h2 ALIGN="LEFT">FEDERAL LAW ON DATA PROTECTION</h2>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 ALIGN="LEFT">1. BACKGROUND</h4>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">DATA PROTECTION HISTORY</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Parallel to the legislative activities in Europe and overseas, a
number of parliamentary
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
interventions were made in 1971 and 1977 in Switzerland. Based
on the work of two
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
commissions of experts, the Federal Council (Swiss government)
presented in 1984 a draft law
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
for the usual consultation procedure. While some fundamental
principles were well received,
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
many interested parties and organisations (including employersï¿½
and industrial organisations)
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
criticised the regulation of private and public activities in
one single law. The principal criticisms
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
were that the law was unduly complicated and bureaucratic. It
was also criticised for creating an
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
independent data commission (instead of a data ombudsman).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In March 1988, having taken into account some of these comments,
the Federal Council proposed
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
a bill for a Federal Law on Data Protection (FLDP) to
Parliament. The new law was approved by
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
both chambers on 19 June 1992. Under Swiss Law, this new
legislation could have been
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
submitted to the Swiss people for a referendum. However, the
term to ask for a popular vote
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
expired on 28 September 1992 and the FLDP entered into force on
for 1 July, 1993.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The FLDP will be complemented by an executionary regulation to
be published in June 1993.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">ACTUAL LEGAL SITUATION</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Until the adoption of the new Swiss Law, data protection in the
private sector was governed by
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
Article 28 paragraph 1 of the Swiss Civil Code (SCC). According
to its provisions, the treatment
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
of data is not allowed if it leads to a violation of the
personality or harms its honour or public
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
reputation.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Industry codes of practice and guidelines as well as provisions
in established data protection
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
practice provide additional protection in specific branches
(e.g. medical sector, market research
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
and direct marketing). Data protection in the field of banking,
insurance and pension privacy is
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
assured by the well-known strict secrecy obligations in these
areas.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Data protection in the public sector is based on Article 8 of
the European Convention on human
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
rights (ECHR). Several directives and regulations of the Federal
Council are currently filling the
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
gap in data protection until the FLDP becomes law. In 1981, a
Federal Office for Data Protection
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
was established. While most of the Cantons introduced cantonal
data protection laws to assure
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
compliance with the ECHR, the Federal government has no
constitutional power to legislate on
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
data protection in the cantons.
</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<h4 ALIGN="LEFT">II. FEDERAL LAW ON DATA PROTECTION</h4>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The FLDP provides for an overall framework and deals with data
protection using similar
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
principles applied in other countries. The law enhances the
protection of private persons provided
</font>

<font FACE="Times New Roman">
by the SCC and regulates in a more detailed manner the treatment
of data by Federal authorities.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman">Private persons need no previous licence to treat data and
registration with the Federal Data
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Register is required only in certain specific cases. Although
the majority of interested parties
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">asked for separate treatment of the private and public sectors,
the law covers both to ensure
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">harmonised development and to facilitate the access of the
individuals to the data protection
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">system.

<p ALIGN="LEFT">SECTION 8 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
</font>&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">MAIN PROVISIONS</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The purpose of the FLDP is to protect the privacy, interests and
fundamental rights of data
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">subjects. Furthermore, it has as its central goal</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* to maintain good data file practice; and</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* to facilitate the international data exchange by providing a
comparable level of protection.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The FLDP has a very wide scope of coverage and applies to
personal data file activities carried
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">out by Federal authorities, private organisations and individual
private persons (excluding normal
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">private purposes). While data collections kept by journalists
and by the media are covered under
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Article 10, they benefit from several additional exceptions
(i.e. provisions regarding freedom of
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">the press and speech).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The law covers data on private persons as well as on legal
persons and applies to both Electronic
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Data Processing (EDP) and manual files (Article 2, Article 3
paragraph a). The transfer of data
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">abroad is not allowed if adequate data protection cannot be
assured (Article 6 paragraph 1). A
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">prior notification of the cross-border transfer is needed except
in cases of a legal obligation or if
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">the data subject has been informed, at least implicitly, of the
transfer.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Data must be collected lawfully and should be done in good faith
(Article 4).&nbsp; Any treatment must
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">ensure accuracy and be balanced. They must be secured against
unauthorised access.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the data subject must be informed of the purpose of
the collection, have a right of
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">access (Article 8) and benefit from a right to correct errors
(Article 5).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sensitive data - such as those relating to religion, political
convictions, trade union activities,
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">health, race, social assistance or criminal punishment - enjoy
in several respects a more effective
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">protection.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">All data registers held by Federal authorities must be
registered with the Federal Data
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">commissioner. Private persons only have to register data
collections if they include sensitive data
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">or if they are communicated regularly to third persons and if
there is neither a corresponding legal
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">obligation nor information on the data subject (Article 11).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Federal Council has the responsibility of establishing the
detailed rules relating to the
</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">execution of the FLDP.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman"></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">PRIVATE SECTOR LEGISLATION</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Data collection by private persons must not harm the privacy and
personality of the data subject.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman">In general, there is no violation if the data have been made
publicly available without reserve to a</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">future treatment (Article 12 paragraph 3). The treatment can be
justified by consent, by law or by</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">an overwhelming private or public interest, such as:</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* data collection in connection with the conclusion of a
contract,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* credit information,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* research and statistics (provided no individual data subject
can be identified), or</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">* publication in media.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Private persons can mandate third parties to treat data on their
behalf if no secrecy obligation is</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">violated. In such cases, third parties may benefit from the same
justifications as the file controller</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">(Article 14).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">PUBLIC SECTOR LEGISLATION</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the public sector, the FLDP regulates the collection and
treatment of data by Federal authorities</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">only. The activities of cantonal and communal authorities are
governed by cantonal law. The</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">major proportion of the Swiss cantons have introduced laws on
data protection in their area with</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">rules similar to those on Federal level.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Federal authorities may collect and treat personal data only if
authorised or to fulfil a legal</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">obligation (Article 17). Special rules apply for files held to
fight certain criminal activities (e.g.</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">organised crime, terrorism) or to ensure military security
(Article 24).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Personal data can only be made available to third parties on a
clear legal basis, to fulfil legal</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">obligations or in case of consent (Article 19). A data subjectï¿½s
name, address and birthday may be</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">communicated without the provision of legal grounds. Personal
data may only be used for</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">statistics, planning and research if (i.e. in case of
publication) an individual person cannot be</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">identified (Article 22).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">FEDERAL DATA COMMISSIONER</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Federal data commissioner (FDC) is appointed by the Federal
Council and supervises the</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">compliance of Federal authorities with the FLDP (Article 27). In
the private sector, the FDC acts</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">as an ombudsman. The Commission can only investigate and give
binding decisions to private</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">persons in cases where data collections have been registered, in
cases of cross-border transfers</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">and if the methods of data treatment endanger the privacy of a
larger number of individuals</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">(Article 29).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">FEDERAL COMMISSION ON DATA PROTECTION</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Federal commission on data protection is appointed by the
Federal Council and acts as an</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">appeal body against decisions of Federal authorities in relation
to data protection as well against</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">cantonal judgements based on Federal public law on data
protection.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">PENALTIES</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Private persons violating their obligations with respect to
information, notification and granting</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">access to information can be punished with a fine or detention.
Unauthorised access to sensitive</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">data can be punished with a fine or imprisonment, i.e. the data
subject enjoys all usual remedies</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">available under normal civil procedure (i.e. interdiction, right
to correct or compensation of</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">damage).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<h4 ALIGN="LEFT">III. OBLIGATIONS OF FILE CONTROLLERS AND RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS</h4>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no obligation for private persons to establish formal
procedures or to ask for permission</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">before beginning a collection of data except in cases where
sensitive personal data are handled or</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">where data are communicated to third persons and only if there
is neither a legal obligation nor</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">any information of the data subjects concerned.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The data subject generally has the right to inspect and to
correct false, incomplete or erroneous</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">data. This right may only be restricted if there are
overwhelming public or private interests.</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">There, is however, no obligation of automatic notification as is
the case in other countries.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The file controller has the responsibility of assuring the
security of the data and is required to</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">prohibit unauthorised access. Under the FLDP, the Federal
Council has the flexibility to issue</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">detailed prescriptions on security procedures not only in the
public, but also in the private sector.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<h4 ALIGN="LEFT">IV. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW CONDITIONS</h4>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The FLDP restricts the transborder delivery of data in those
cases when there is a need for the</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">protection of privacy. Delivery may be restricted if, for
example, the recipientï¿½s country cannot</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">provide an adequate level of data protection. A notification of
the FDC is only necessary if the</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">data subject has not been informed of such a transfer. However,
such notifications may be</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">presumed in many cases. During the parliamentary debates, the
Federal minister of justice</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">specified that, for example, such knowledge can be presumed if
personal data are exchanged</font> <font FACE="Times New Roman">among different companies of a multinational group.</font></p>
