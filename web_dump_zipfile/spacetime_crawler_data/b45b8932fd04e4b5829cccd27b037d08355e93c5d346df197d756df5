<p>Professor Qi Alfred Chen in the Computer Science department of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at University of California, Irvine (UCI) is hiring <b>multiple motivated PhD students</b> in the area of <b>network and systems security</b>, especially in <b>securing exciting IoT/CPS systems</b> such as <i><b>self-driving cars</b></i> (<a href="jack_iv17.pdf">link1</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6979/4358928/06899663.pdf">link2</a>), <i><b>intelligent transportation</b></i> (<a href="alfred_ndss18.pdf">link1</a>, <a href="yiheng_trb18.pdf">link2</a>), and <i><b>smart homes</b></i> (<a href="jack_ndss17.pdf">link1</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3196494.3196498">link2</a>). </p>

<p>Professor Chen is an expert in <b>discovering and fixing security problems in emerging technologies</b> such as smartphone, smart home, and smart transportation. His work has found multiple security flaws in both computer systems such as Android and smart traffic light system, and computer network protocols such as in TCP and DNS. These results led to <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-144A">a U.S. DHS (Department of Homeland Security) US-CERT Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alfchen/impact.html#vuln">multiple CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and Android bug tracking records</a>, and email acknowledgements from security teams in Apple, Microsoft, and Comcast. His research was published in all the top-tier systems security conferences (IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, CCS, and NDSS), and covered in more than 50 news articles by major technology new media such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2014/08/22/gmail-smartphone-app-vulnerable-to-hackers-researchers-say/">Fortune</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/08/android-attack-improves-timing-allows-data-theft/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/researchers-find-way-to-hack-gmail-with-92-percent-success-rate/">CNET News</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28895304">BBC News</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/obscure-app-flaw-creates-backdoors-millions-smartphones/">Wired</a>, etc. More details can be found in his webpage at <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alfchen/">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~alfchen/</a>. </p>



<p>Any students with strong background on the system and/or networking knowledge, or with good programming or reverse engineering skills are encouraged to apply. Security background, static or dynamic program analysis, sensor/analog security, and/or adversarial machine learning experiences are not required but big pluses. If you are interested in practical security problems and enjoy hacking, the position would be an excellent fit. </p>

<p>University of California, Irvine (UCI) is ranked <b>#33 in USA universities (#7 in public universities)</b> by U.S. News & World in 2018. The computer science department is ranked <b>#30 by U.S. News & World based on reputation</b>, and ranked <b>#23 by CSRanking (https://csrankings.org) based on research publications</b>.  Irvine is a perfect place to live for its (1) <b>safety</b>, since it is one of safest city in US for the 13th year, (2) <b>food and shopping</b>, since it is next to Los Angeles so it has the best Chinese food and shopping malls across US, (3) <b>weather</b>, since it is alway sunny, (4) <b>attractions</b>, since it is close to not only all the top theme parks such as Disneyland and Universal Studio, but also the best beaches around the world. </p>

<p>All applications need to be submitted through <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/grad/admissions/Prospective_ApplicationProcess.php">the official admission website<a>, with the <b>deadline at 12/15/2018</b>. However, if you have questions or are really interested in the research topics and want to introduce yourself, you can drop your CV and transcript (unofficial is fine) at <a href="mailto:alfchen@uci.edu">alfchen@uci.edu</a>. </p>
