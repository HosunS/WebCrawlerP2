 1. Follow the submission requirements (5%)
   * Code is structured as required (e.g., the directory structure)
   * Makefile works
   * Code compiles and links correctly

  Please make sure that your submission follows these requirements and can be unzipped and built by running the script we provided. Failure to follow the instructions could make your project unable to build on our machines, which may result in loss of points.

   * Implement all the required functionalities
   * Implementation should follow the basic requirements of each function, such as file should be created on disk.
