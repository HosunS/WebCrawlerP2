You wrote to my brother-in-law Joel Ives about Pesach Langsam.  That was 
my father's hebrew name, English Paul Langsam.  When we moved a cousin of 
ours gave me an entire digest of Langsam's we have not unpacked this as we 
are in temp housing till our knew house is built.  You might have interest 
in that.  If you wish more info about our family my grandfather his 
children etc. please advise.  Only my cousins are alive none of the direct 
descendants of my grandfather Nathan are.  I believe I was named for my 
fathers grandfather one Ephraim the other Fimeth which one was a Langsam 
could be in the volume of family tree I alluded to.

    I would be very interested in any detail you could provide. Is the digest
    you speak of a white soft-covered book with the title Langsam~Spira Family?
    Have you had a chance to check out my website at:
    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/hometree.htm
    I would be interested in anything you could tell me.
    Thanks!

I believe the book had a blue cover and am not sure what the names were on 
the outside.  Unfortunately we are not moving until June and have no idea 
what box the book is in.  I will however check with my sister and one of 
my cousins to see if they might have a copy.
My father was one of 5. One sister died at 11 the others were all older 
Irving,Lillian and Martha.  Lillian was never married and Martha was 
married late in life no children. Only Irving with wife Bessie who I never 
knew as they were divorced had two sons Ralph and Herbert Langsam.  Ralph 
with his wife lives in Palm Beach Gardens and he has twin daughters Carol 
and Diane.  Herbert like my father was a pharmacist.  Extremely successful 
with nursing homes lives in Okla.City has one daughter who I never met.

I passed your message on to my sister-in-law Phyllis who lives in Ohio.
She is not involved in genealogy.
