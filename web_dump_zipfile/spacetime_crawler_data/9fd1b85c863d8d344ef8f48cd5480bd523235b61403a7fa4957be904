<h1>Greedy Algorithms as Navigation Problems</h1>
<h2>Nil Mamano</h2>

<p>What do hierarchical clustering, geometric stable matching, and
combinatorial optimization problems have in common? In all three areas,
there are problems that can be solved effectively using greedy
algorithms, and (as we will show in this talk) many of these problems
have an underlying combinatorial structure that can be exploited to
speed up the runtime of the greedy algorithms. We focus on the use of a
specific technique and its application across all three fields: the
nearest-neighbor chain algorithm. This technique originated in the
context of speeding up hierarchical clustering algorithms in the 80s,
and a slight variation was recently used to the same effect in the
context of some stable matching problems. Independently, Robert Preis
developed a linear-time two-approximation algorithm for the maximum
weighted matching problem using similar ideas. In this talk, we work
toward unifying all these algorithms into a single framework, and extend
the techniques to other problems such as maximum independent set and set
cover.</p>
