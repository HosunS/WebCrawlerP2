<h2>  A Road to the Stars;  Space Research Vehicles</h2>                    
<p> <LI>  Somewhere in the vast reaches of the universe lies a galaxy. 
Within 
that galaxy the planet<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-earth.html"> 
Earth</a> travels 
in an endless rotation around the planet in the center of its<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-solarsystem.html"> 
Solar System</a> the Sun. On this planet is a 
lifeform like no other. These life forms are known as human beings. For 
thousands of years these humans have been fascinated with the Heavens, 
and even entertained notions of space travel. The last part of this 
century has seen these fascinations become reality. However only in the 
last three decades has it been possible for man to place his tools and 
himself beyond Earth's atmosphere. Americas spacecraft have taken men to 
the Moon, landed on Mars, and explored the region around<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-jupiter.html"> 
Jupiter's</a> moons. 
They have also mapped Earth, and provide continous<a 
href="http://thunder.atms.purdue.edu/">meterological data</a> from Hawaii to 
Maine, and from Alaska to Florida.<p> 
<LI>     American spacecraft programs are separated into three 
categories. 
<a href="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html">NASA</a> managed 
programs which are 
primarily scientific in nature. Which include spacecraft such as the <a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html">Viking</a>,<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html"> Voyager</a>, 
<a href="http//nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/magellan.html">Magellen</a>, 
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/galileo.html">Galileo</a> 
and<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mariner10.html"> Mariner 
10</a> satelites used to probe Earth as well as other planets. 
NASA has also managed unmanned landings on the<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-moon.html"> 
Moon</a>,<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-venus.html"> 
Venus</a>, and<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/PhotoGallery-Mars.html"> 
Mars</a> as 
well as the many manned trips to the Moon in the<a 
href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo.html">Apollo lunar 
landings.</a> 
<LI>The second type of program is that of commercial spacecraft. Which 
for 
the most part are designed and built by private manufacturers. For 
example the RCA company built and launched it's own satelite system 
called SATCOM. Another large company that takes advantage of space age 
technology is AT&T. They use the HS376 satelite made by the<a 
href="http://info.stx.com/"> Hughes</a> 
aircraft company. This particular satelite is a good example of a 
succesful commercial aircraft. Hughes has built and marketed 30 of theses 
aircraft to companies located around the globe.
    <LI> The third type of spacecraft are military spacecraft, like NASA 
many 
of the militaries aircraft have been built by private customers. There has 
always been intense competition between the United States military 
services, but that has been replaced by cooperation between forces. The 
Air Force conducts the majority of Department of Defense launches 
including those of Navy Spacecraft. The Air Force manages the NAVSTAR 
Global Positioning satelite, but all of the armed forces use it.<p>
 <LI>American spacecraft are launched from three sites within the 
United 
States. These are the<a href="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/"> Kennedy Space 
Center</a> at Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
<a href="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/about/about_gsfc.html">Wallops Flight 
Facility</a> at Wallops Island, Virginia. The last would be 
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Kennedy Space Center is 
responsible for the launches of all the planetary probes, and also all of 
the manned space flights.<p>
<LI> Officially known as the Space Transportation System, the<a 
href="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_overview.html#sts_program"> 
space shuttle</a> is the most important earth-orbit program ever undertaken by the 
United States. The space shuttle can be used to perform scientific 
experiments, carry satelites and place them into orbit, it can be used to 
retrieve satelites and repair them in space. The shuttle can carry both 
civilian and military payloads. The basic idea of having a space shuttle 
solely rests on the concept of a reusable spacecraft. The shuttle orbiter is
basically the largest spacecraft ever put into orbit, 
It posed no small problem for designers. It would have to be launched 
like a rocket, orbit like a spacecraft and return to Earth like an airplane. 
The designers final result was the space shuttle. There were six 
space shuttles built in all, The<a
