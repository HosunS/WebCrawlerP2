==== AREM ====
AREM is a tool for ChIP-seq analysis, and is able to discover peaks in repeat regions of the genomes. AREM is available at [[software/arem | Aligning Reads from ChIP-seq data by expectation-maximization ]]

==== tree-hmm ====
Tree-HMM is an extension of the popular ChromHMM for doing clustering of epigenetic markers. Given a complete set of epigenetic markers for several cell types, and the phylogeny describing their relationship, Tree-HMM will perform approximate inference on the graphical model induced by connecting genomic positions of a certain cell type in a chain while also connecting different species according to the tree.  Thus, each internal node's state depends on its "vertical parent" (parent cell type) and its "horizontal parent" (adjacent genomic region).

Code is available at [[https://github.com/uci-cbcl/tree-hmm]] and some sample data is available at [[http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/tree-hmm-sample-data]]
