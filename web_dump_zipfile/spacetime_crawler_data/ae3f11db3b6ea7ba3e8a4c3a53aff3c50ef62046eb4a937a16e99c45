<H3>Three Web Thrills &agrave; la Sepi:</h3>
<ol>
<li><A HREF="http://inls.ucsd.edu/y/OhBoy/randomjump1.html">A Thousand Points
of Sites</a>: Well, almost a thousand points, and almost all of them work.
This was a very valuable jumping off point for some of the other finds I made 
on the Web. Although not all of the sites work and the site does 
depend on visitors leaving interesting sites. This leaves some of the sites
as opportunistic advertising rather than as a &quot;fun&quot; site.
<li><A HREF="http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~ta/lb/lb.html">Lite Brite</a>: A
site for you to use to relieve the tensions of the day. You get to make the
photons that come off the screen work for you rather than have them fatigue
your eyes.
<li><A HREF="http://clunix.cl.msu.edu/weather/">Current Weather Maps and Movies
</a>:Whether you want to fly around the world or walk out of the Office of
Academic Computing labs and stay dry, this is &quot;Weather Central&quot;!!!
Beware though that the pictures are nice, but the large weather maps take a
long, long, long time to get back to you.

<p><HR>
<OL>
<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>Do You Have A Voice on The Web?</H2></A>
The simple answer is, <em>yes</em>!!! I decided to check the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html">
internet resources meta-index</a>
under the &quot;Navigate&quot; menu of Mosaic. The
Meta-Index is a collection of Web resource directories and other indices.
&quot;Meta, &quot; based on the Webster Dictionary (on ea, not the Web
interface, which provided no answer), means
&quot;more comprehensive, transcending,&quot; and this index lives up to
this definition.
At the index, which I opened by accident, I went to the
<A HREF="http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/s?main.gmm">Cybersight</a>, where you
arrive into a world of optical illusions, and some sites to jump to. This is
when I chose the option for
<A HREF="http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/s?poll.gmml">polls</a>. You find that
you not only have a voice, but you arrive where you can voice an opinion on 
which voice you like the best. People can see what current feelings are on
issues such as the
<A HREF="http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/ballot/oj?1">O.J. Simpson trial.</a>
These polls allow one to give an opinion and see total results
<i>immediately.</i> I thought, based on television and newspaper
&quot;polls&quot;, that many people
think O.J. is innocent and that they feel that his status as a national
&quot;hero&quot; would not earn him the death penalty. After responding to the
poll, I found 54% of respondents believe that the death penalty <i>is</i>
warranted, with 31% objecting not because of O.J., but because they are against
capital punishment.
The media may affect people's impressions, but the immediate feedback of the
poll on the Web is much more convincing. One aspect to take into account though
is the diversity, or lack thereof, of people responding to the poll. As yet,
the Web is still a mystery to many people.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is a Transparent GIF???</H2></A>
When I decided to put the above Anteater in this document, I opened an
unexpected can of worms. Steve Franklin, instructor of the ICS
1C course, wrote back to my query of how I could get the image to my home
directories, and I realized that I had forgotten some fundamentals. Steve
reminded me that I could use the URL (that I had discovered) to open the
image with mosaic, which would open the &quot;add on&quot; viewer xv to view 
the image. But I saved the image to my home directories using xv, which made 
the image retain its <A HREF="anteater.gif">white background</a>.
This means the image is <em>not</em> transparent. A
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html#transparent">
transparent GIF</a> is one where the background of the image blends with the
background the browser has decided to use. The <A HREF="#Anteater">above
photo of Sepi K.</a> is an example of a transparent GIF.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>How Much Computing Power Does it Take to Analyze a 
Protein?</H2></A>
This was something I totally stumbled upon in a team quest to find a California
home page. After seeing that South Dakota had a Web home page, we figured that
California <em>must</em> have a home page. On my hotlist is a page of 
<A HREF="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/meta-index.html"> WWW Search Engines.</a> We
looked up California at the documentation level of this page, using the NCSA
Docfinder slot, and instead of getting pages about California,
<A HREF="http://docfinder.ncsa.uiuc.edu:7999/bin/finder?California">
we found 78 records</a> associated with California. Based solely on the titles
of the search results, I chose to look at a page named
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/MetaCenter/SciHi93/1a.Highlights-BiologyA.html">1a.Highlights-BiologyA.html</a>. At the bottom, a
&quot;button&quot; pointed to the right, and I followed it to
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/MetaCenter/SciHi93/1b.Highlights-BiologyB.html">Distributing Molecular Dynamics Calculations</a>. This page takes a
look at using parallel linked supercomputers to compute the folding
patterns of proteins. The limiting factors on computing, up to this point, have
been modeling the effects of water molecules on protein folding. It is
necessary to account for at least 5000 water molecules when considering these
interactions, and this requires massive computing power. It seems that
distributed computing allows different computers to work together by giving
each computer the task best suited for it.

<A NAME="QQ4">Where can you get an Appendectomy on The Web?</A>
<A HREF="http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VirtualHospital.html">
<IMG SRC="http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VHLogoSmall.gif" ALT=[Hospital]>
</a></H2>
Well, you may not want to do an appendectomy after reading this page (unless
you have a strange inkling to use your &quot;sterile&quot; Swiss Army knife)
but you can certainly learn how to conduct one in a sterile operating theatre
by learning how to become a health professional.
<A HREF="http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VirtualHospital.html">The Virtual
Hospital</a> of the University of Iowa maintains a page on the medical
profession, and an extensive collection of medical journals about radiology,
as it is the radiology department at the U of Iowa that maintains these web
pages.
Something I found of great interest, especially as a pre-med bio-major, is the
information about the <A HREF="http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/ICM/ICM2.html">
medical student curriculum.</a> There was also an intersting page as an
<A HREF="http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/ICM/IntroFiles.html">introduction to
clinical medicine.</a> It contained the transcribed notes of a medical student
during the spring semester of 1992, and certainly taught me a little about
the paranasal sinus disorder (sinus infection) that I had earlier this quarter.
I found this site through the
<A HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov/network/science/biology/index.html">
USGS biology server reference page</a> which was a part of the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html">
internet resources meta-index</a>

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>Where can one get good Irish Coffee and Islamic
Doughnuts?</H2></A>
The man to ask is named
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/~david/index.html">David (david@gdol.com)</a>,
and his home page is amazing!!! He is
<b>LINKED!!!</b> If you enjoy fine foods and lots of culture, you have
found the man, and the web site to check out. This site caught my eye because
it has 
<b>FREE</b>
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/~david/food/coffee.gif">coffee</a> and
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/~david/food/donuts.gif">donuts</a>!!!
Coffee and Donuts, juxtaposed by a man that loves all things 
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/kearns-l/irish.cgi">Irish</a>
and also has an interest in
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/~david/islam.html">Islam</a> and
<A HREF="http://www.gdol.com/~david/islam.html">Morocco</a>,
where is wife is from. He keeps a neat, tidy, and updated web page, and
he even has a region of the page which recognizes the client computer
running your browser, and gives you, as a user,
<em>(user@rigel.oac.uci.edu)</em> things you
might be interested in. He doesn't get your login, but at least gets where you
are visiting from. If David's coffee is not the roast that you are looking for
you can always stop by the
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html">
Trojan Room Coffee Machine</a>. A camera is trained on a coffee pot in the
<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/site-maps/arup2.html">Trojan Room</a> of
the  University of Cambridge computer labs.
When you click on the image of the pot, an up to date image of the pot is taken
and sent to you in the JPEG graphics format. Keep these sites in mind when
working late at night on HTML.
