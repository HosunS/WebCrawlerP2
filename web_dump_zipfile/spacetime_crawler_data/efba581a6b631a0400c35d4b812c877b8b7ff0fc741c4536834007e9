            We depend heavily upon users to let us know about content that may violate our

            content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the
            content, refusing to print the content and limiting or terminating a user√¢¬Ä¬ôs access to
            Google products. Note that we may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic,
            educational, or documentary considerations, or when there are other substantial
            benefits to the public from not taking action.
          </p>
          <p>
            We occasionally modify these policies, so please check back here for any updates.

                content removed or be permanently banned from using the Services. In emergency
                situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to law enforcement.
                Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have
                serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.

              <p>
                Our Services enable discussion of many topics, but we do not allow content that

                gambling, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons,

              </p>
              <p>
                Because these topics are often heavily regulated and may not be appropriate for all
                ages or in all countries, we have created tools on Google+ to help you target your
                content to users of the appropriate ages in the right markets. If your content
                promotes regulated goods and services, you are responsible for applying the
                appropriate age and geographical restrictions for that content where these tools
                are available. If we receive a complaint that such content is targeting audiences
                in violation of applicable laws and regulations, we may remove or restrict the
                offending content or account.
              </p>

                Even with the appropriate age and geographical restrictions in place, we still do

                We do not permit terrorist organizations to use Google+ for any purpose, including
                recruitment. Google+ also strictly prohibits content related to terrorism, such as
                content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist
                attacks.

                If posting content related to terrorism for an educational, documentary,
                scientific, or artistic purpose, be mindful to provide enough information so
                viewers understand the context.
