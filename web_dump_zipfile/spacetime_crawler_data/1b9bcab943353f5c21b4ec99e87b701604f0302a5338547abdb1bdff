<H2 align=center>Format of family trees</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Each direct descendent of the Head of the tree is described in one line, with
  <UL>
  <LI> generation number
  <LI> gender &mdash; '<tt>x</tt>' for male, '<tt>o</tt>' for female, '<tt>?</tt>' for unknown
  <LI> given name
  <LI> surname in ALL CAPS
  <LI> birth and death dates (if known) and city (if known)
  <LI> if known, a '#' precedes a reference number to a record in the archival book of that year
       <BR>for the city of Krakow, unless another city is cited
     <UL>
       <LI> in some instances, an event was recorded in a later year,
         <BR>in which case that fact will be shown in parentheses.
         <BR>For example: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
             <tt>Mar 15, 1834 (1836 #75)</tt>
         <BR>indicates that the birth on Mar 15, 1834
           was recorded in birth record 75 of the year 1836 in Krakow
     </UL>
  </UL>
<P>
<LI> A person's spouse is shown in the following line
  <UL>
   <LI>'<tt>+</tt>' before the name indicates a wife
   <LI>'<tt>*</tt>' before the name indicates a husband
  </UL>
<P>
<LI> The children of a (married) couple are shown,
   in chronological order when birthdates are known,
   <BR>under the lines of the (married) couple
   <B><font color=blue>with a common indentation</font></B>
   <BR>and a common generation number that is one more than their parents'
<P>
<LI> A person's second spouse (presumably after death or divorce
     of the first spouse)
     <BR> is shown after the lines of the descendents of the first spouse
<P>
<LI> '<tt>??</tt>' to the left of a person's entry indicates significant uncertainty of the association of that person to the family.
   <BR>Such uncertainty typically arises as to whether
     <UL>
     <LI> that person is a child of the listed parents, or
     <LI> one of the listed parents is the true parent for that subfamily
 (as opposed to some other person with the same name)
