        <strong>Building an e-commerce powerhouse</strong>
        <p><strong>By Courtney Hamilton</strong><P><B><I>As CEO of EYEMAGINE, alumnus Andy Etemadi continues to utilize what he learned as an ICS student in the &rsquo;90s to remain at the forefront of the e-commerce industry.

</I></B><P>
                <p>

<IMG SRC='/bin/img/features/eyemagine-rotator.jpg' STYLE='width: 100%; '>



<p>
Donald Bren of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) alumnus Andy Etemadi (B.S. &rsquo;99) studied software design and architecture on the cusp of a computing revolution&mdash;where personal computers became household standards and Internet usage ubiquitous. Today, he&rsquo;s founding CEO of 
<A HREF="http://www.eyemaginetech.com/">EYEMAGINE</A>, 
a full-service e-commerce agency that he bootstrapped just four years out of college. Based in Irvine, EYEMAGINE assists businesses in all aspects of e-commerce, including design, development, marketing and integration of online stores. The award-winning company counts industry heavyweights like The Walt Disney Co., HP and Toyota among its clients, while also providing quality service to younger businesses. Below, Etemadi recounts how his time at ICS influenced his career, while also offering advice to current students from the dual perspectives of a former student and a modern CEO.

 
<p>
<B>Describe your college career at ICS.</B> <BR>
I studied software design and architecture at ICS from 1996-1999 and graduated in 1999. During that time, I learned how to use email at the ICS lab before everyone started using the Internet. Actually, I think the ICS lab first introduced me to the Internet. It was wild, the first time I used an Apple computer was at the ICS lab, as well as the first time I used the Linux operating system. I still use Linux and those software tools today, almost 20 years later.

 
<p>
<B>What was it like to attend ICS in the midst of the personal computer and Internet surge?</B> <BR>
I was really fortunate; the timing was in my favor. I didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen with the Internet, technology and software. When I started at ICS, the experience was eye-opening and challenging. I learned a lot of advanced software theory and software development. Everything and anything to do with computer science and software, I was learning at ICS; I had no idea at the time that it would be my future. One of the most important things was learning how to learn about technology. Even today, when I approach problems and technology situations that I&rsquo;ve never seen before, I&rsquo;m able to reuse what I learned at UCI to solve and approach problems, as well as deal with and understand new technologies.

 
<p>
<B>Tell us about EYEMAGINE and the type of services it offers?</B> <BR>
EYEMAGINE is a full-service e-commerce agency that helps businesses sell their products online. We design, develop and integrate online stores. We also offer marketing to help businesses get new customers and retain those customers through email marketing and valuable content like buyers&rsquo; guides and e-books. It&rsquo;s a highly targeted message that we send out to customers where they receive value and engage with the online business.

 
<p>
<B>How has your education assisted you in your day-to-day at EYEMAGINE?</B> <BR>
We work with new software platforms and software practices all the time. In June, I attended the Internet Retailers Conference and Exhibition (IRCE), which is a trade show about software and solutions in e-commerce. Most of the software exhibited, individuals and companies want to introduce themselves to the marketplace. Even though the software languages used to create solutions may not have changed for many years, we&rsquo;re partnering with these companies and being asked to introduce their software to the marketplace&mdash;to learn these new technologies, become experts and implement them.
 
<p>
Every time we come across a new software platform, we&rsquo;re learning a new technology. Typically, there&rsquo;s no training package with an instructor on hand to walk us through all the details of the software. We actually have to download the software, look at the source code and get a pretty good understanding by knowing software best practices. We evaluate new software platform packages two to three times a year. I learned those best practices during my time at ICS.

 
<p>
<B>Explain the process of starting EYEMAGINE.</B> <BR>
It was a big risk and an exciting adventure. It started in 2003, just about four years after I graduated from ICS. I had been creating online software for other companies while consulting. I was being asked to do more projects, and that just snowballed. I started the company and went off on my own. There was a big demand for mobile and online applications.
 
<p>
Around 2006, EYEMAGINE started hiring full-time employees, moving into an office and growing as a company, taking on more and more work. We focused on e-commerce: helping businesses sell their products and services online, working with payment processors, and customizing the user experience. In fact, the United States is one of the leading countries in e-commerce technology, and it moves so fast. It&rsquo;s so far advanced from where we were just one year ago; we continue to innovate and build on our success. Bootstrapping a company is challenging because it&rsquo;s tough to build success that is tangible. Every step the company takes forward requires a lot of attention, planning and effort&mdash;but it&rsquo;s exciting.
 

<p>
<B>Where did you get the idea for EYEMAGINE? What led you to e-commerce?</B> <BR>
I was a general software development consultant and responded to the market, and the market was asking for e-commerce. Amazon and eBay paved the way for amazing and effective customer experiences. We noticed that other kinds of businesses and enterprises wanted to leverage the work that Amazon and eBay had done. These small to midsize businesses are not Amazon, though, so they need help from an agency or expert to deliver similar experiences at a fraction of the cost. Being at the forefront of e-commerce technology, we&rsquo;re able to leverage that research and technology for hundreds of small and midsize businesses.

<p>
<B>During your time at UCI, what were you involved in beyond ICS?</B> <BR>
The experience at UC Irvine was so great. I was able to learn advanced information, but also be around other people who had similar interests in technology. Going from high school to a university, that type of focus and being around people with similar interests was a new thing. At that time, my interests included technology and new things that were happening with the Internet&mdash;believe it or not, a new thing at that time. Socializing on the UC Irvine campus was a great experience; there was a lot of freedom and opportunity. I still remember walking over the bridge to In-N-Out. Every time I go past that bridge, I think about my time at UC Irvine. I see all the new buildings and developments since I was there; the Internet bubble has burst and inflated again. I&rsquo;m thankful for how opportune the timing was for me to join the ICS program and get that education. I think it&rsquo;s much harder now&mdash;the barrier to entry is much higher because UC Irvine has become such an amazing destination for computer science students that I don&rsquo;t even know how I&rsquo;d stack up against students today.


<p>
<B>Was it a deliberate decision to keep EYEMAGINE headquartered in Irvine?</B> <BR>
Absolutely. It was a strategic decision to stay close to a tech hub, and close to UC Irvine with such talented students, professionals and businesses that are serious about their own growth. I think Irvine is the center of technology and business for Orange County. If you don&rsquo;t want to leave Orange County, Irvine is, without a doubt, the best place to be for a technology company.
 

<p>
<B>How big is EYEMAGINE today?</B> <BR>
We&rsquo;re just under 30 people in the office, and we have plans to grow both in revenue and infrastructure. We want to grow but continue to deliver high-quality services. Managing growth is always a challenge, but we&rsquo;re excited about a future of more businesses needing e-commerce help. They have built their own legacy, but may need help coming on to new platforms and upgrading their own infrastructure. We&rsquo;re helping those businesses take advantage of this opportunity, while lowering their costs and increasing their revenue.
 
<p>
EYEMAGINE counts among its clients The Walt Disney Co., Toyota and Nokia. How does the company secure and maintain industry heavyweights?
The most effective way to secure those big names is to do really good work and be known for our quality and knowledge. We&rsquo;re a small shop, so to work with big enterprises like HP, Disney, Toyota, we have to be subject matter experts. We have to be effective with the scope of work we deliver.
 
<p>
We take that same knowledge and apply it to smaller and midsize businesses that are also growing, regardless of their revenues. If it&rsquo;s a healthy business, it&rsquo;s a healthy business. We pride ourselves on doing quality work that large enterprises can benefit from, but we also do that work for everyday businesses. Building a business is a combination of delivering high-quality work and sharing what we do with the market&mdash;our marketing team has done an amazing job of really engaging the marketplace, communicating our service capabilities, and exposing our services to businesses.
 

<p>
<B>What sets EYEMAGINE apart in the e-commerce market?</B> <BR>
What sets us apart is our partnership with the merchants that work with us. Rather than approaching as vendors, we align ourselves with the merchants and become their partners online. We learn their businesses and understand them, and then we help them with online strategy and execution. Our focus is based on goals: We create goals with our merchant partners that we both align on. We deliver those services successfully, which is very difficult in this day and age because e-commerce is growing so fast. It&rsquo;s very easy to say that &lsquo;a company does e-commerce,&rsquo; when really the staff doesn&rsquo;t have the knowledge to be effective. We have the track record, case studies and reputation that, combined with where we are in the market, are very unique.

<p>
<B>What advice would you offer students graduating with ICS degrees?</B> <BR>
My advice to students is to focus on something that you have a passion for, something you&rsquo;re really interested in, and then pursue the companies and businesses that meet your skillset. Keep your attention on the niche: that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll realize the most value for your effort. In technology, having a niche is incredibly valuable. Becoming an expert should be the No. 1 focus of every undergraduate. Once you become an expert, you can get into the driver&rsquo;s seat and carve your own path. It&rsquo;s so rare to stick with a single company or career. If you have the talent, knowledge and endurance to grow in a career with one company for five or 10 years, your value could be through the roof. There are so few people who will be there with you as an expert.
 

<p>
<B>What would you look for in a potential hire? What skills should ICS students hone to be great candidates?</B> <BR>
We look for soft skills as well as capability as software developers. Some of those soft skills include commitment to task, written and verbal communication, attitude and general disposition. Those types of values are important to small, growing companies. It goes a long way to be able to work with other people; you support your team by being a good team member. It&rsquo;s also important to be flexible and adaptable to circumstances and situations, especially in technology because the nature of the work evolves over time. Additionally, teammates, staff and managers change all the time, so flexibility is very important.
