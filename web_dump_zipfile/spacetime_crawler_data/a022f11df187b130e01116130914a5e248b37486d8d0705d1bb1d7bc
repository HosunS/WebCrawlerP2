I am new to researching my family, and by accident I came across your family tree.  I have a 
Pesel Sauerhaft who married a David (?).  They had several children, one of whom Rachel (?) 
married a Shmiel Langsam during the war.  They both died in 1942.
 
Do I have the right family tree.  If not, please point me in the direction where I may continue 
my search.
 
Thanking you in advance.
 
Howard Nightingale

Hi,
Thanks for your inquiry. I am researching ALL Langsam's in the belief it is one large family. 
The core seems to be primarily in Galicia and Slovakia. There were many Samuel (anglocized 
version of Shmiel) Langsam's in our family. Can you elaborate at all? Wife's surname (David's)?  
Where they lived? Shmiel's parents? Age? What is your source for Shmiel Langsam? Do you know of 
other Langsam's from his family?

Please stay in touch.

Good Luck!
-Moishe

Thank you for your answer.    The information I have on the family is as
follows:


Ephroim and Rifka Sauerhaft had four children:  
Fayge Leah (who married Aaron Adler) 
Pesel who married (David?) 
Golda ( who married Lazar Wiesenfeld) and 
Yaakov Baruch (who married Sheinder Rikel)   

Pesel and David
had  five children: Moishe, Itzik, Rifka, Reisel and Rachel (who married
Shmiel Langsam)  

Ephroim and Rifka lived in Bialoboki, Poland.  Pesel was born in Bialoboki, 
Poland and then married David (?) and moved to Drobitzka (it may be Debica).
David (?) was a farmer.


I hope that this helps.


Looking forward to your reply - maybe we are related.


Howard

Hi,
Do you have dates (or years) of birth for Rachel and Shmiel? Have you found anybody with more 
knowledge of this Shmiel?

I read your post in the most recent Jewish Gen email.

I have a Langsam in my family tree and have been unable to connect him to any other Langsam family

Pesel Sauerhaft (born in Bialoboki) married David ? and lived in Drobitzka (Debica?).   They had several children one of whom was a daughter Rachel. She married Shmiel Langsam during WWII and both perished.

Does this ring any bell?

My family comes from Manasterz, Jawornik Polski, Zagorze, Kanczuga, Gac, Jaroslaw and other shtetls in the area.

Howard,

Thank you again for your inquiry. We were in touch several years ago. See:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/shmiel.htm 

Do you know the year of birth for Rachel? And how do you know she married Shmuel? Where did they marry?

BTW, all of your places of research overlap with mine. 

Moishe Miller

Moishe, now that you mention the prior email I do remember.  I have no date of birth for Rachel.  The information on the family came from my cousins,(Shmuel Lazar Goldman was born in 1906 in Gac and Reizel Sauerhaft born in Zagorze on March 1 1907 [based on naturalization records when she came to Canada) whom  I interviewed between the early 1970s to the late 1970s.  They are now deceased.
