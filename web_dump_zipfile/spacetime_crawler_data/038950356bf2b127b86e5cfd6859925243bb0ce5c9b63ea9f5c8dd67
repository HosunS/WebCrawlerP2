A recent SODA paper by Chepoi, Dragan and Vaxes [CDV]
presented linear-time algorithms for computing the diameter and
center in several classes of face-regular planar graphs.  Among
these classes of graphs are trigraphs (triangulations in which inner 
vertices have degree >= 6), triangular systems (triangulations in
which inner vertices have degree = 6), and hexagonal systems (subgraphs
of a regular hexagonal grid, bounded by a simple circuit).  In
this talk, I will discuss some of their results, focusing on the 
problem of computing the diameter.
