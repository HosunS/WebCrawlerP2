<H1>Computers: the new teachers aid.  </H1>

<P>Computers are growing rapidly and stronger every day.  Just about a 
decade ago, computers existed but were not widely implemented in the 
classroom.  Today, however, children in the first grade are very aware of 
computers and are computer literate.  This is the computer generation.  
Kids in malls are now playing with the computers displayed at Sears or 
Radio Shack with great ease.  Now computers are taking a new step by 
taking an active part in education.  In reality, it is not so new since 
pilot projects have been out there for a number of years, but now almost 
every school has at least one computer on their campus.
<p>  Computers are now being tied to education and are used as tools to benefit the learning 
process.  In fact computers have revolutionized <A 
HREF="http://www.gse.uci.edu/"><B>education</b></A> by bringing in new teaching 
methods that are current with the rapid technological changes.  We are begining 
to explore what we can call the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the 
potential computers and the internet has in aiding the classroom environment. <A 
HREF="gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Science/cecsci.03"> Science</A> and <A 
HREF="gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Math/cecmath.08"> math </A> 
have been the focus of many internet projects and lesson plans for teachers are 
available on line thru the internet. Many agencies have taken an interest on how 
the internet can be use and are exploring the posibilities of appling the use of 
the net to  every subject taught in school.  For example <A 
HREF="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasa_online_education.html">Nasa,</A> and the <A 
HREF="http://www.si.edu/"> Smithsonian Institution </A> have created their 
home page with a list of sources related to education and the uses of the internet.  

<P>Teachers are no longer working in a classroom alone.  Through the 
network, they are able to exchange lesson plans, communicate with other 
educators, and compare methodology.  We are now hitting a new era of <A 
HREF="http://k12.cnidr.org:90/edref.connection.html"><b>Educational 
Reform and Computers.</b></A>  In fact, the University of Houston has 
established a <A 
HREF="gopher://state.virginia.edu/00/TEIS/About_STATE_dir/Introduction"><i> 
teacher education internet server. 
</i></A>  This server provides access 
to an internet gopher ( these are documents stored int he net which may 
contain sound and images) and discussion groups (these are interactive 
discussions in the Internet).  Teachers here can be informed of the 
latest developments.
<P>With the teachers being well-informed, they now have to transmit this 
to their classroom.  The Department of Education at UCI has worked with 
a project called KIDS-NET.  It is a forerunner of the concept of the 
usage of the Internet in education.  It was funded by National 
Geographic, and the Drug Free Schools of the Department of Education 
conducted these studies.  They had their own central site that was 
assisted by Sprint Net.  Schools subscribe to this privately owned net 
and would get a unit to work with.  The introductory unit was called 
HELLO, and they were hooked up to other schools.  Students would connect 
on to this net and have interaction with other schools.  Several schools 
in the United States were connected through this net during the summer.  
A student from California could compare the rainfall here with a student 
all the way in Texas.  It was aimed at children in the elementary level 
and focused on having students do hands-on work in the sciences.  UCI was 
in charge of administering the  pre and post testing and analyzing the 
statistical data to ensure that the project was working properly.
<P>There is now another project out there that schools are using per 
semester called the <A 
HREF="http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP.html#top"><b>Computer as Learning 
Partner</b></A> (CLP).  It is an integrated energy curriculum teaching the 
physical sciences topics of heat, light and sound at the middle school 
level.  Schools are now aiming at a hands-on, laboratory-based curriculum 
for almost all subjects rather than just a text-based curriculum.  
Schools want more student-teacher interaction, and that is what the <A 
HREF="http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP/General_Information/info.html#Project">CLP project</A> has to offer.  It is not serving as a substitute for the teacher, but acting as a backbone to the class.  Computers provide the tools that textbooks cannot give to th
e students.  It emphasizes <A HREF="http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP/CLP_Curriculum/everyday_problems.html">realistic problems.</A>
Computers act as partners to the students by providing the components to 
perform experiments and sample models.

<p> New teaching strategies are being developed to complement the use of 
computers.  Many fear that by having children sit in frot of a computer to learn 
may isolate them into a world of their own.  But teaching strategies such as 
cooperative learning and new sources of assessment along with computer usage 
complement each other.  Cooperative learning involves student intearction in the 
classroom.  The teacher is not the only one talking and teaching the lesson.  
Students are grouped to work together emphasizing their strong points.  This 
could be done in every subject.  Teachers are also trying to integrate the 
subject and not separating math with science and english but making on flow with 
the other.  Computers can do since it is able to integrate more than one 
topic.  Finaly the use of new assessment methods such as using a portfolio and 
teaching other children make a difference in learning.  Test can not always tell 
a teacher if in fact the student is learning.  Computers help the retention of a 
child since they see it, read it, explore it, interact with it, and enjoy it.

<P>Educational use of computers is not limited to the classroom setting, 
but it could also be integrated in the home. <A 
HREF="http://www.lanl.gov/temp/Education/Introduction.html"><b>Science at 
home</b></A> was piloted in Spring of 1994, and was presented to families 
to see how each family member can participate in scientific discovery.  


Computer usage in education has been quite successful, and will soon 
become an essential part of the classroom setting.
