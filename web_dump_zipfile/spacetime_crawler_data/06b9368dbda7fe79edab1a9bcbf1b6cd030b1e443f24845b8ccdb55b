Biography

Kai Zheng, PhD, FACMI, is Associate Professor of Informatics and Associate Adjunct Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of California, Irvine. He also directs the Center for Biomedical Informatics at the UC Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational Science. Prior to joining UC Irvine, he was Associate Professor of Health Management and Policy in the School of Public Health and Associate Professor of Information in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. He was Director of University of Michiganâ€™s Health Informatics Program preparing students for careers that will harness the power of information to enhance health and transform individual health and healthcare. Zhengâ€™s research draws upon techniques from the fields of information systems and humanâ€“computer interaction to study the use of information, communication, and decision technologies in patient care delivery and management. His recent work has focused on topics such as interaction design, workflow and sociotechnical integration, and diffusion and evaluation of health IT. His recent work also includes use of computational methods to augment the value of unstructured free-text data such as clinician notes and patient-generated content online. Zheng received his PhD degree in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University. He was the recipient of the 2011 American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) New Investigator Award that recognizes early informatics contributions and significant scholarly achievements. He is an elected Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics, and currently serves as Chair of AMIAâ€™s Clinical Information Systems Working Group.Mis_redirected¢DtypeEvalueôIhttp_code¢DtypeEvalueÈQdownload_complete¢DtypeEvalueõ
