<p>
Yuzo Kanomata works on developing media services for the DVAS project and for DIP gaming project. These areas include examination of Flash based services through Red5, capture of video data on multiple platforms and Virtual Worlds, and web-based collaboration and meeting technologies. 
</p>
<p>
Yuzo Kanomata worked on developing the Nutch layer that added crawling and indexing to the collaborative infrastructure project on a grant from the HRI. 
</p>
<p>
Yuzo Kanomata worked on developing the preliminary TMRF budget for the 
<a href="http://www.ase-conference.org/index.html">IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering 2005</a> conference (Nov. 2005, Long Beach, CA). 
</p>
<p>
He is developing the infrastructure for live video webcasts of seminars and events for the Institute.
</p>
<p>
He is conducted research on an NSF supported grant on Ecoinformatics. He is specifically
evaluating tools, methods, and metadata standards and analyzing them through 
software engineering principles and best practices to see if the area can 
develop tools and techniques that will enhance actual productivity in 
Field Ecology as well as being able to scale and levelage COTS components.
</p>

<p>
He is supporting research work on empirical studies of software development 
and the knowledge exchange in programing teams.
</p>

<p>
He has worked on an IBM Eclipse grant supporting the Mrsg 
project. He is responisble for creating XML Data Bindings in Java for the 
<a href="http://www.gupro.de/GXL/">GXL Graph Exchange Language</a>. GXL is being used as the basic description 
language for a number of reverse engineering tools. He has also been involved
in creating the GXL Editor, plug-in, and update site in Eclipse for the project.
He supports all aspects of the software development including CM, Data Base,
Project, and system administration for various tools and platforms ranging from
XP Pro, Solaris, Free BSD, Debian Linux, and Mac OSX.
</p>

<p>
He has been involved in event-based Software Architectures. He has been
 involved in updating ArchStudio 2.0 into a new suite of architecture 
tools (to be called ArchStudio 3). He was a major contributor 
in the creation of xADL 2.0, the XML-based architecture description 
language (ADL), and on the various tools used to construct, analyze, and 
deploy architecture-based systems.
</p>

<p>
He was involved the development of the Web Way-Back machine, which 
provided users a Web Browser based means of accessing archived web pages
stored by the Internet Archive.
</p>

<p>
He has worked on open hypermedia systems with particular
emphasis on Web-based systems.  He has been involved in research and 
development activities on libwww-ada95, Chimera, and WebDAV. 
</p>

<p>
He currently maintains the Software for DAV Explorer, ArchStudio, and
Chimera 2.0b3. He also maintains the webpages for Software Architecture Research
at UCI, the SensOS project, and the Python-to-Palm porting effort.

<h2>Research Interests &amp; Projects</h2>

<h3>Software Engineeering</h3>
<p>
Software Engineering is the discipline of creating and maintaining complex 
systems using software. This discipline's scope is very wide, from the 
instructions on computing devices to programs that affect 
the society at large, Software 
Engineering is the conceptual and the concrete application of software 
to build systems of use. Here at the 
<a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">Institute for Software Reseach</a>, the 
concerns of Software Engineering are attended to by the various research 
concerns of the faculty. Reverse engineering (the discovery of the principals
and facts about a software system from the software itself), 
software architecture
(the methods of constructing, reasoning, and maintaining software systems in 
systematic component-based approach) , and HCI (the study of the interaction 
between humans and computers) are all active areas of research and the 
projects and topic below reflect what my concerns and actions have been 
in enhancing the field of Software Engineering.
</p>
<h3>Software Architecture</h3>

<p>
Software Architecture is an active area of research at UC Irvine. To Learn 
about Software Architecture, follow the links to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture">
Wikipedia Software Architecture</a> 
entry or you can visit the 
<a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/">UC Irvine Research 
Group's Software Architecture page.</a> Note. this page is to be updated in October 2005. Contact me directly and I can help you with current information.
Here is a page I collected from other folks ideas on 
<a href="software-architecture.html"> Software Architecture</a></p>


<h3>Reverse Engineering Plug-in for IBM Eclipse</h3>
<p>
GXL is a widely used XML-based graph description language used in the reverse 
engineering community to communicate data between reverse engineering tools. 
Yuzo created the GXL Java Data Bindings, an XML Schema for GXL, and an IBM 
Eclipse Plug-in to display and manipulate GXL. Cross tool converters were 
added so that tools could be front and back-ended into the plug-in.
</p>

<h3>ArchStudio 2.0</h3>
<p>
ArchStudio is a collection of Software Architecture tools in a single 
program suite. These tools are integrated using the C2 framework and
operate on a shared general XML based Architecture representation known
as xADL. ArchStudio provides a set of tools which can be used to examine
and test architectures, and has facilities that enable run-time modification
of the system on-the-fly.
</p>

<h3>Chimera 2.0</h3>
<p>
Chimera is an open hypermedia system deeply integrated with the WWW.  
Chimera offers
hyper-text functionality (e.g., n-ary links and  non-embedded links) that 
are not available on the Web while at the same time leveraging Web-based 
protocols for scaling to large distributed collections of resources.
This allows Chimera to link together applications, even those which are
not web-enabled, in order to form meaningful collections of artifacts.
</p>

<h3>WebDAV</h3>
<p>
WebDAV is a widely supported IETF standard for distributed 
authoring and versioning
of documents across the Web.  Work here at UCI has included major input
to the protocol as well as development and distribution of the 
first WebDAV client application, DAVExplorer. 
(DAV Explorer is the most used and most interoperable client currently
in wide use.)
The WebDAV protocol is being 
supported by a number of leading software companies such as IBM, Microsoft, 
Adobe, and AOL. 
</p>

<h3>libwww-ada95</h3>
<p>
libwww-ada95 represents an attempt to provide the Ada95 language with a
set of Web libraries in order for the language to utilize the WWW.
Based on the work of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/">Roy Fielding</a> 
(libwww-perl), this project delivered 
a set of basic functions which provides Ada95 programers tools to build
Web servers and applications.
