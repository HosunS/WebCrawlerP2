<H3> Brief BIO </H3>

I am a fourth year undergraduate at UCI. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Math. I am interested in areas of complexity theory like circuit lower bounds, psuedorandomness and derandomization. I am also interested in areas of theoretical cryptography like oblivious ram and multiparty computations. I also enjoy economics and have an interest in Algorithmic Game Theory.
<BR>I have been involved with the ACM club on campus and have taught a year long course on competitive programming.

<H4> CURRENT PROJECTS </H4>
I am currently working on understanding the structure of popular marriages. Popular marriages is a weaker notion than stable marriage, it is defined on incomplete preference lists and popularity implies a matching that is a condorcet winner amongst all other matchings in the graph. The problem is especially interesting because we can efficiently compute min-size popular marriage and max-size popular marriage , but if we ask about the existence of k-size popular marriage in between the problem becomes NP-complete. <BR>

<H4>PAST PROJECTS</H4>
<H4>TIPPERS</H4> 
I worked on TIPPERS under Professor Sharad Mehrotra for 3 years and was funded by a DARPA grant. Most of my work relied on implementing sensor subsytems around donald bren hall and providing a mechanism for data capture from all these sensors. At a high level the problem we were trying to address was the following, aggregate queries could have large privacy implications. For example knowing the power consumption of the whole floor could tell who is in the building at some particular time. The project used techiniques like differential privacy to approach the problem. <BR>
