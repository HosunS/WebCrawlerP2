<h1>CS/CSE 161, Fall 2015:<br> Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Instructors and office hours</h2>
<p>The course will be taught by <a href="/~eppstein/">David
Eppstein</a>, eppstein@uci.edu (office hours Tues 2:30 &ndash; 3:30 and
Weds 3:30 &ndash; 4:30 in Bren 4082). The teaching
assistants are <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jlam2/">Jenny Lam</a>
(office hours MWF 9:00 &ndash; 10:00 in Bren 4011)
and <a href="mailto:siluy@uci.edu">Silu Yang</a>
(office hours Tues 6:30 &ndash; 7:30 and Thurs 12:30 &ndash; 1:30 in
Bren 4011). We also have three readers.

<h2>Lectures and discussions</h2>
<p>The course meets for lectures Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, from 2:00 &ndash; 2:50, in the Howard Schneiderman (Biology) Lecture Hall, Room 100A. In addition there
are discussion sections, Mondays and Wednesdays 6:00 &ndash; 6:50 in SSH 100
and Tuesdays and Thursdays 8:00 &ndash; 8:50 in ELH 100. Students are expected
to be enrolled in one of the two discussion sections and to attend
discussions regularly. At the discussion
sections, the teaching assistant will go over homework and midterm
solutions, give additional examples of topics covered in the lecture,
and be available to answer questions.</p>

<p>Lecture materials will not be distributed to the class; instead, you are encouraged to attend the lecture yourself and take your own notes. Recording the lectures for your own personal use is allowed, but other uses of recorded lectures (including making them available online) is forbidden.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The course text will be "Algorithm Design and Applications" by
Goodrich and Tamassia (Wiley, 2015;
see <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-825796.html">publisher
site for special direct student purchase price</a>).
Students are expected to own a copy and to read the relevant chapters
and sections. The official version of the textbook is the one sold in
the bookstore. Most homework problems will be assigned from this text.
If you are using a different version (e.g., an
international version, or the older text by the same authors), then it is your responsibility to make sure you
are doing the correct homework problems.</p>

<h2>Homework and grading policy</h2>
<p>Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (typically due on Fridays and posted on this page before the start of class on Monday of the week it is due)
as well as two midterms and a comprehensive final exam. The overall
grade will be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and
40% from the final.</p>

<p>Group work on homeworks is permitted; each student
should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. Some of the
homework problems will ask you to perform calculations or trace the
steps of an algorithm; you are welcome to use computer programs
to solve these problems rather than doing everything by hand.
Each week's
homework assignment will be given on this web page. Homework is due by
9:00pm on Fridays and must be turned in through dropbox
on eee. No late
homework will be accepted. Homework must be typed, and formatted as a
pdf file. Handwritten homework or homeworks in other formats will not be
graded. Students who add the class after the start of quarter will be
responsible for turning in all earlier homeworks by the following
Friday. The lowest homework score of the quarter will be dropped from
the course average.</p>

<p>For the UCI honesty policy, please see <a href="http://honesty.uci.edu/">honesty.uci.edu</a>. Students who are caught cheating in this class (for instance by copying exam solutions or allowing other students to copy from them) risk getting an F in the class or other disciplinary action as allowed by this policy.</p>
