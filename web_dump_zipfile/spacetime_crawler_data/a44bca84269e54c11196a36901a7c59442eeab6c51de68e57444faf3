<H1 align=center>CompSci 165 Team Registration and Project Submission/Evaluation</H1>

<H2>Project Policy</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Each project is to be done by teams of size two (see Team Policy, below)
<BR> <B><font color=red>IMPORTANT:</font></B> "Done by teams" means that
     team members must each contribute substantially to the project submission.
     <BR>It is <B>not</B> acceptable for team members to independently
     develop the project and then decide which member's work is to be submitted.
<LI> You may make use of <B>ideas</B> found in any book, journal, or website,
     or obtained from talking with any person.
    <BR>
     HOWEVER, you must be careful to give proper attribution to any such sources
    <BR>
     by indicating in your code and in your project write-up the full reference
     for each such source
      <UL>
      <LI> book/journal title, author, and page number, or
      <LI> full URL of the webpage, or
      <LI> name of the person from whom you received a "private communication"
      </UL>
<LI> <B>Code</B> must be original, and may not be copied or shared from any
     other source, except as provided by the class instructor
</UL>

<H2>Team Policy and Registration</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Teams for each of the CompSci 165 projects consist of <U>two</U> CompSci 165 students
<LI> For each project, students choose their teammates by mutual consent and agree who will be the team head member
<LI> For each project, the <U>head member</U> of each team shall register the team members using the registration form found at <a href="PROJECTS/Register165.html">this</a> location
<!--
<LI> For each project, the <U>head member</U> of each team shall send a "registration email"
   <UL>
   <LI> to be sent from the head member's UCI email address
   <LI> to be sent to <B><font color=red>cs165@ics.uci.edu</font></B>
        and to the other team member's UCI email address
   <LI> contains (1) full name and (2) UCInetID of each of the project team members
       <BR> but do <U>not</U> submit student numbers
   <LI> to be sent before 9:00am on the <font color=blue><I>registration due date</I></font>
          listed on the Class Schedule
   </UL>
   A return email will acknowledge receipt of the team registration
-->
<LI> Students who have not been registered for a team before 9:00am on the registration due date will be assigned to teams by the instructor
   <UL>
   <LI> the instructor will also designate who is to be the head member for assigned teams
   <LI> students on assigned teams will receive email notification
        of their team membership roster
   </UL>
</UL>

<H2>Project Submission</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Projects are to be submitted to the class dropbox before 9:00am on the <font color=blue><I>submission deadline date</I></font>
          listed on the Class Schedule.
<BR> Instructions for using EEE dropbox can be found at
     <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/help/dropbox/students/"><tt>https://eee.uci.edu/help/dropbox/students/</tt></a>
<LI> <B>No late submissions will be accepted</B>
<LI> For each project, the <U>team head member</U> should submit
     a zip file containing all required deliverables
   <BR><B><font color=red>IMPORTANT:</font></B> Submit only one zip file that contains all files you wish to be considered.  Do <B>not</B> submit any other files.
<!--
       <UL>
       <LI> source files
       <LI> (<tt>makefile</tt>, enabling automatic compilation
       <LI> <tt>README.txt</tt>, containing documentation, analysis and other comments
       <LI> if you have any, sample run outputs should be in a file
            named <tt>OUTPUT.txt</tt>
       </UL>
-->
</UL>

<H2>Project Evaluation</H2>

Projects will be evaluated based on the following broad criteria
<UL>
<LI> <I>Correctness</I> &mdash;
  the program system works <B>according to project requirements</B>
  <UL>
  <LI> C/C++ source compiled using gcc/g++ on Linux
  <LI> no syntax errors, no run-time errors,
       and the correct output must be produced
  <LI> improper input gracefully handled, allocated space returned
       after it no longer is needed,
       <BR> and error-checking performed after calling any system or library function
  </UL>
<!--
<LI> <I>Testing, timing</I> &mdash;
  correct implementation of ancillary functions needed for
  the complete project but not part of the project specifications
  <UL>
  <LI> code needed for I/O
  <LI> code needed for testing
  <LI> code needed for timing
  </UL>
-->
<LI> <I>Program structure</I> &mdash;
   modularized, concise comments, indentation, descriptive variable names, explain "magic" numbers
<LI> <I>Documentation</I> &mdash; <font color=red>keep this very short please</font>
  <UL>
  <LI> how to compile and use the program
  <LI> description of data structure implementation
  <LI> theoretical resource complexity analysis of the underlying algorithms
  <LI> production of a function (based on empirical observations and analysis)
       <BR> to predict resource complexity for larger instances of the problem
  </UL>
<LI> <I>Efficiency</I> &mdash;
  each project may specify special features or competitive characteristics
</UL>
