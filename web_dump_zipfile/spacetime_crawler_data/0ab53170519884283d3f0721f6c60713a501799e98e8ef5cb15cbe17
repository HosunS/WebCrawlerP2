<H2 align=center> CompSci 267P Project </H2>

This project can be done by an individual student or by a team of two CS 267P students.
Quality expectations are higher for team projects.
<BR>
Write a short (5-7 page) paper that summarizes the results of
your implementation/analysis of an advanced compression technique.
<BR>
Your paper will give background (describe the problem, its motivation,
and approaches to its solution) and give some solution analysis
(absolute or comparative).
<BR>
Suggestions of how one might obtain
some improvement would be great, and achieving actual improvement
would be wonderful.
<P>
Your project might be one or more of: a survey, a theoretical discussion
of aspects not covered in the literature, an analysis of your or
someone else's implementation, etc.
<P>
You should browse appropriate journals and conference proceedings
to consider candidate topics for this project.
<BR>
<!--
I do maintain a small <a href="otherrefs.html">list of papers</a>
that I am particularly interested in being considered by class students.
<P>
As a rule, I will not approve a proposed topic if it
has already been approved for someone else in the class.
<BR>
Thus, there is some incentive for submitting your proposal
well ahead of the deadline.
-->
<P>
Note that, besides the technical content,
clarity, structure, grammar, and spelling will also have an effect
on your grade.
