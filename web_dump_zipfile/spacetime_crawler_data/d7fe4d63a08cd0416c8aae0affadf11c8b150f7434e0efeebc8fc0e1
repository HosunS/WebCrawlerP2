3. Abstract
This dataset is created by reading out 200 files from the 10 largest Reuters 
classes and using an Automatic Speech Recognition system to create 
corresponding transcriptions.

5. Data Characteristics
This data was created by selecting 20 files each from the 10 largest classes 
in the Reuters-21578 collection 
(http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/). 
The files were read out by 3 Indian speakers and an Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR) system was used to generate the transcripts. More about the 
ASR system can be found in [1]. Such a dataset will be really helpful to 
study the effect of speech recognition noise on text mining algorithms. 
The first work which refered to this dataset was on noisy text classification[2].

7. Data Format
There are 10 directories labeled by the topic name. 
Each contains 20 files of transcriptions.
