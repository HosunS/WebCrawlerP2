</DIV>
<P>Given any two crossing circles A and B (blue), there exist two more circles 
C and D (red) through the two crossing points, that bisect the angles made by A 
and B at those points.  If any two circles E and F (green) are tangent to 
each other, with E and F both tangent to both of A and B, then the 
tangency between E and F lies on one of C or D.  Further, if (say) the 
tangency lies on C, then C is perpendicular to both E and F.

<P>As usual, this can be proven easily by
<A HREF="inversion.html">inversion</A>: just invert by a 
circle centered on one of the crossing points of A and B, so that A and B 
are transformed to two crossing lines, and C and D are transformed to the 
two angle bisectors of those lines.

<P>Note that the angle bisectors, and their property of containing the 
tangents of pairs of disks tangent to each other and to A and B, continue 
to exist even when A and B do not cross, even though in this case there is 
no longer any angle to bisect.  In this case, the existence of these 
circles is again seen by inversion, to a configuration in which A and B are 
concentric. The existence of these bisectors is especially useful for 
constructing instances of <A HREF="steiner.html">Steiner's porism</A>, 
rings of tangent circles between two circles, since it gives a point on 
each successive tangent circle from the previous one.

<P>If we are given any point x on C (or D), we can construct the tangent 
circles E and F using the <A HREF="four-circles.html">four-circle 
property</A>: the four circles A, E, the line L through x and the center 
of C (viewed as an infinite-radius circle), and a circle along the line 
perpendicular to L through the center of A together form a cycle of four 
tangent circles, three tangencies of which are known or easily 
constructed.  The fourth tangency, of A with E, is then the point where 
the circle through these three tangencies crosses A.  Once we have 
similarly constructed the tangency of B with E, we have three points on E 
from which the circle itself is easily found.
