The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a
lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of
development of devices for their use.  Our ineptitude in getting at
the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of
indexing.  When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed
alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is)
by tracing it down from subclass to subclass.  It can be in only one
place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which
path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome.  Having found one
item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a
new path.

<p>

The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association.
With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is
suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some
intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.  It has
other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently
followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is
transitory.  Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the
detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.

<p>

Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially,
but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it.  In minor ways he
may even improve, for his record have relative permanency.  The first
idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection.
Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be
mechanized.  One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility
with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be
possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and
clarity of the items resurrected from storage.

<p>

Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of
mechanized private file and library.  It needs a name, and to coin
one at random, ``memex'' will do.  A memex is a device in which an
individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and
which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed
and flexibility.  It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

<p>

It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a
distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works.
On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be
projected for convenient reading.  There is a keyboard, and sets of
buttons and levers.  Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.

<p>

In one end is the stored material.  The matter of bulk is well taken
care of by improved microfilm.  Only a small part of the interior of
the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism.  Yet if the
user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds
of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter
material freely.

<p>

Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for
insertion.  Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals,
newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place.  Business
correspondence takes the same path.  And there is provision for direct
entry.  On the top of the memex is a transparent <a
href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?platen">platen</a>.  On
this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sort of
things.  When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to
be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex
film, dry photography being employed.

<p>

There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the
usual scheme of indexing.  If the user wishes to consult a certain
book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book
promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing
positions.  Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom
consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key
projects it for his use.  Moreover, he has supplemental levers.  On
deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book
before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just
allows a recognizing glance at each.  If he deflects it further to the
right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at
100 pages at a time.  Deflection to the left gives him the same
control backwards.

<p>

A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the
index.  Any given book of his library can thus be called up and
consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a
shelf.  As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item
in position while he calls up another.  He can add marginal notes and
comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography,
and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus
scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad
waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.
