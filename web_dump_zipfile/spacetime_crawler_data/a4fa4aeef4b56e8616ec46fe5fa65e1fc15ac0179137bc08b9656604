        <h3>
          <em>Textbook</em>
        </h3>
        <p>There is one required textbook for the course: </p>
        <p>A First Course in Probability</p>
        <p>Sixth Edition,&nbsp; by Sheldon Ross (Prentice Hall 2002). </p>
        <p>The textbook explains the subject material in detail. It is strongly recommended that you read the book <strong>and</strong> attend all lectures and all meetings of your discussion section. You will be responsible for all material               covered in the lectures and discussion sections, and for all               assigned reading in the book. </p>
        <h3>
          <em>Course Grades</em>
        </h3>
        <p>There will be 7-8 homeworks , one midterm and one final.. Homework will be assigned each Wednesday and will be due the following week.&nbsp; The weighting scheme for the final grade is: </p>
        <p>Homework assignments 15%<br />
          Midterm 35%<br />
          Final                 50% </p>
        <p>We will drop the two lowest homework scores in determining your final grade. The midterm exam will be given in lecture. It is scheduled for Wednesday, February 12. The final examination is scheduled for TBA. </p>
        <p>A work-related conflict is <strong>NOT </strong>a valid reason for postponing an exam. The dates of the exams are being announced now. Plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>Please bring your student ID to all exams.</p>
        <h3>
          <em>Obtaining               Assistance</em>
        </h3>
        <p>The best way to get your questions answered is by coming to lecture, section or office hours and asking them there. </p>
        <p>Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on&nbsp;             the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at             (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such             accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</p>
        <h3>
          <em>Announcements</em>
        </h3>
        <p>Class announcements will be made in lecture and in section. Important announcements will also be posted on the class Web page. </p>
        <h3>
          <em>Homework and Handouts</em>
        </h3>
        <p>The homework assignments will be handed out at the beginning of lectures and posted on the Web. </p>
        <p>The homework problems are an integral part of the course. They complement the material covered in the lectures by providing examples, applications, and extensions. You are strongly encouraged to attempt all problems. Even if you cannot solve them, if you have tried hard to solve them you may be more likely to understand and               remember the solution. Our brains learn something while attempting               to solve a problem, even (and perhaps especially) during failed               attempts. So do not get discouraged if a problem is difficult.</p>
        <h3>
          <em>Discussion Section</em>
        </h3>
        <p>You must be registered for a discussion section. The discussion section provides you with an opportunity to ask questions about the lecture material. It is strongly recommended that you attend a discussion section regularly. You are responsible for all material covered there.<br />

          <em>Late Assignments</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>Homework assignments are due every Wednesday by 2:00 PM. <strong>Absolutely no homework assignments will be accepted after 2:000 PM</strong>. If your homework is not turned by               then, you will receive a 0. </p>
        <h3>          
          <em>Grading</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>Only parts of the homework assignments will be graded. However, you will not know which particular problems will be graded before you hand in your assignment. All the problems in the midterm and the final will               be graded.</p>
        <h3>          
          <em>Questions on Grading</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>Any questions regarding grading should be directed to your TA first and then to me during office hours or before or at the end of the lectures. </p>
        <h3>          
          <em>Collaboration</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>You are allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss the solutions to the homework with your fellow classmates. However, you are required to sit down and write up your own solutions independently. In               addition, you need to write down the names of any classmates with               whom you have collaborated on a given assignment, clearly indicating               that they are your collaborators. Copying the homework assignment of               another student is considered cheating. Keep in mind that the               homework contributes little to your final grade in comparison to the               midterm and the final. Thus, it is very much in your own best interest to have a               thorough understanding of the homework assignments. </p>
        <h3>          
          <em>Academic Honesty</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>Cheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously. Any such incident will result in a letter describing the incident which is placed in your file on campus. Depending on               the severity of the incident, the resulting grade can range from an               F on the particular examination to an automatic F in the course.               Additional penalties may also be imposed by the department and the               university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result               in suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>
        <h3>          
          <em>ICS Change of Grade Option Policy</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to change their grade option is the end of 6th week with instructor's approval. Dean's signature (available at the ICS Student Affairs office) will               be required after the deadline and the ICS Student Affairs office               does not allow a change of grade option for any course after 6th               week, unless the student has documented a medical or financial               hardship.</p>
        <h3>          
          <em>ICS Add Deadline</em>          
        </h3>
        <p>The ICS departmental deadline for any ICS major to add an ICS course is the end of 3rd week with instructor's approval. Any course additions after the 3rd week of classes requires Dean's signature               and careful review by the ICS Student Affairs office. If you are               adding a course after the 3rd week, please go to the ICS Student               Affairs office.<br />

								A coin is flipped 1,000 time s and  700 heads are observed. Using a simple family of models parameterized by p (the probability of heads on a single toss) derive the Maximum Likelihood estimate of p. Using a Beta prior on p, with parameters a and b, derive the Maximum A Posteriori Estimate of p. What happens if the prior is uniform? What if a=b=5? In both cases, plot the prior and posterior densities.

								You are interested in estimating the number of email messages received by the UCI campus in one day (email addresses ending in "uci.edu"). Prior to seeing any data, provide a reasonable guess and standard deviation for your estimate. Imagine that on two different days, the actual number of messages is: 210,000  and 220,000. How would this change your estimate and why? Build a Maximum Likelihood and Maximum A Posteriori framework for your answers.

								<li>Let X and Y be two  0-1 variables with P(0,0)=0.1, P(0,1)= 0.1, P(1,0)=0.2, P(1,1)=0.6. Computer the marginal  probabilities of X and Y. Are X and Y independent? Computer the  Covariance and the Correlation Coefficient between X and Y.</li>
								<li>A webmaster of a particular web site is interested in studying the relationship between the indegree X of a web page and the number Y of its visitors per day. After monitoring the web site for a few days he finds the following average values:<br />
									X=2 Y= 21; X=3 Y=33; X=5 Y= 55, X=10 Y=99, X=20 Y= 220</li>
