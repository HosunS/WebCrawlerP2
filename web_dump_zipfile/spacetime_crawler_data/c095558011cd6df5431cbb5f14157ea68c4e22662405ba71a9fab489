<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Assignment 1 ï¿½ Using
common graphics and tools ï¿½ <u>Due April 23, 2009 in class</u> (in lieu of
weekly example)<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below is a partial table of data (also available at <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/inf143-SQ09/Assignment1/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/inf143-SQ09/Assignment1/</a>
in .xls format and tab separated text). It contains fictitious data for
students in a class: student id, major, class standing, completion of
prerequisites, numeric grade, and letter grade. For part of the assignment, you
should double the size of the table adding in your own data. The remainder of
the assignment is as follows. Using your favorite spreadsheet or data plotting
software, create a graphic answering each of the following questions. Also, in
each case, explain in 1-3 sentences why the graphic is appropriate / good for
answering the corresponding question. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A) Frequency / counting: How many students are in each major
(in the class)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B) Percentage: What percent of each major makes up the
class?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>C) Distribution: What is the distribution of the letter
grades (A-F)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>D) Comparison: How did the performance of students with
prerequisites compare to students without them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember to double the size of the table with your own
imaginary data before doing the graphs. Have fun with the data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point of the exercise is two-fold. First, you should
learn how to use the graphing features of a common tool (such as Excel) to do
simple graphs. If you already know one tool, challenge yourself by trying out a
new tool (e.g. <span class=SpellE>OpenOffice</span>). Second, you should learn
to choose the best graphic for answering common questions. </p>
