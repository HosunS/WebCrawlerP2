<H2>CompSci 260 Homework Submission - Fall, 2018 (Dillencourt)</H2>

<p>
You will be submitting your homework to a system called <b>GradeScope</b> 
which assists us in grading and giving you feedback. 
In order to submit your homework, you will need to create a scanned pdf,
store it on your computer, and then submit it to your GradeScope account. 
</p>

<p>If you do not already have a GradeScope account, go to 
<a href="https://gradescope.com">gradescope.com</a>
to create one. 
<b>Your Gradescope account must use your UCI Email and not some other 
email account.</b> 
</p>

<p>Once you have created your GradeScope account, add yourself to this course.
The course code is <b>9WB3XD</b>.
</p>

<p>
Instructions on how to create a scanned pdf file of your homework and 
how to upload it can be found at:

<p>
You can handwrite or typeset your homework. Your homework must be uploaded
as a PDF file.  If you scan your homework to create the PDF, you must use 
either:
<UL>
<LI> a desktop scanner; or
<LI> a scanning app (such as <i>Scannable</i> or <i>Genius Scan</i>).
</UL>

<p>
After you have uploaded your homework, use the GradeScope interface to indicate on which page(s) 
your solution to each problem is.
</p>

<b>Please note:</b>
You may not just take a photo of your homework and upload the jpeg, 
or embed the jpeg in a pdf file. 
If your homework is not readable by the readers, they will not grade it 
and you will receive a 0 for the assignment
</p>


<p>
If you choose to typeset the homework, 
please use a proper equation editor. 
Your solutions should not contain text like "x^2" because 
that it too cumbersome for the readers to parse. 
Also, your notation should match the notation used in the text.
</p>
