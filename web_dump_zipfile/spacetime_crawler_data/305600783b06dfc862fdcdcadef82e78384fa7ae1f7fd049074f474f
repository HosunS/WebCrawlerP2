 * Creating a Full Text Searchable Table:
{{{
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ft;
CREATE TABLE ft (
    entryID INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    entry text,
    PRIMARY KEY (entryID),
    FULLTEXT (entry)) ENGINE=MyISAM;
}}}

 * Adding Rows into the table:
{{{
INSERT INTO ft 
VALUES (1,
        'I was born in michigan in 1980 in a small town called Adrian. 
         My mother is named Sue, while my father is named Mike.  They 
         currently live in a small town called East Jordan. On April 
         27th, 2003 I will graduate from Eastern Michigan University 
         with a degree in Computer Information Systems.');


INSERT INTO ft
VALUES (2,
        'While I was at work today I was having some problems with the 
        RAID array. It seems that we have a rogue cron script that is
        causing problems. When I find out more info I will post it here.');

INSERT INTO ft
VALUES (3,
        'After I graduate I am taking a 2 week vacation. On my 
        agenda is a trip to Washington DC to see my girlfriend\'s 
        sister as well as throwing a few discs at the local disc 
        golf course.');
}}}

 * Searching for whole words
{{{
SELECT entryID FROM ft WHERE MATCH (entry) AGAINST ('golf');

RESULT : entryID : 3
}}}

 * Prefix Search
{{{
SELECT entryID FROM ft WHERE MATCH (entry) AGAINST ('grad*' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

RESULT entryID: 1 and 3
}}}


 * Boolean Searches
{{{
SELECT entryID FROM ft WHERE MATCH (entry) AGAINST ('+graduate -michigan' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

# No operator signifies OR operation
SELECT entryID FROM ft WHERE MATCH (entry) AGAINST ('graduate michigan' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
}}}
