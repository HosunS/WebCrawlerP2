<h1>GDB Installation on Mac OSÂ X</h1>
<p>
If you work on aÂ Mac OSÂ XÂ 10.9 Mavericks or later, you will run into
the problem of Eclipse refusing to interactively debug problems that
otherwise build and run fine:
AnÂ attempt to start aÂ debugging session by selecting
<span class="menu">Run<br>Debug</span>
from the menu will result in Eclipse complaining that an
<q>Error with command: gdbÂ --version</q>
has occurred.
</p><p>
The problem is caused by Apple switching away from GDB, the GNU
debugger, to LLDB, the LLVM debugger, in their Xcode toolchain (along
with the transition from GCC to Clang). Unfortunately, Eclipse is not
capable of communicating with any debugger other than GDB (yet).
Here is aÂ step-by-step guide for installing and configuring GDB.
</p>

<h2 id="install">Installing GDB</h2>
<p>
As with GCC, the easiest way to install GDB is through Homebrew.
InÂ aÂ Terminal window, run the command
<code>brew install gdb</code>,
and wait for it to complete.
(As usual, it may ask for your password.)
</p><p>
Now, we need to code-sign the GDB executable, so it will be allowed to
control other processes, as necessary for aÂ debugger.
For that, we will first create aÂ new certificate in Keychain.
</p>

<h2 id="cert">Creating a Certificate</h2>
<p>
Open the Keychain Access application (can be found in
Applications/Utilities directory or through Spotlight).
Select <span class="menu">Certificate Assistant<br>
Create aÂ Certificate</span> in the application menu
(<span class="menu">Keychain Access</span>).
AnÂ assistant window will appear for guiding you through the process.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
First, you will be asked for the name and type of the certificate.
You may choose the name arbitrarily, but to simplify its future use in
command line, prefer names without spaces or other fancy characters,
e.g.,Â <code>gdbcert</code>.
</li><li>
Make sure that <span class="menu">Identity Type</span>
is set to <span class="menu">Self Signed Root</span>,
change <span class="menu">Certificate Type</span>
toÂ <span class="menu">Code Signing</span>,
check the <span class="menu">Let me override defaults</span>
checkbox, and click <span class="menu">Continue</span>.
Click <span class="menu">Continue</span> again in the popup
prompt warning about the certificate being self-signed.
</li><li>
On the next page, leave <span class="menu">Security Number</span>
to beÂ 1, and set <span class="menu">Validity Period</span>
to aÂ large enough number of days to cover the duration of the class
or more, say,Â 365.
(Certificates cannot last forever; the maximum validity period
is 20Â years.)
</li><li>
Then click <span class="menu">Continue</span> once again, and keep
doing so to skip the next six screens until you see the one entitled
<span class="menu">Specify aÂ Location For TheÂ Certificate</span>.
For the only property, <span class="menu">Keychain</span>, choose
<span class="menu">System</span> from the drop-down list.
Lastly, click <span class="menu">Create</span>, type in your
password, if prompted, and click <span class="menu">Done</span>.
</li><li>
Back in the main window, choose the <span class="menu">System</span>
keychain in the sidebar on the left, and select the newly created
certificate from the list.
Open the context menu and select
<span class="menu">GetÂ Info</span>.
In the information window that will appear, expand the
<span class="menu">Trust</span> section and set the
<span class="menu">CodeÂ Signing</span> property to
<span class="menu">Always Trust</span>.
Close this window (you may be asked for your password),
and quit Keychain Access.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sign">Signing GDB</h2>
<p>
Our new certificate is now ready to be used.
In order to make it immediately available for signing, we need to
restart the Taskgate access-control service.
You can use Activity Monitor to do this (also found in
Applications/Utilities).
Open it and filter the list of processes by typing
<code>taskgated</code> in the search field in the toolbar.
(IfÂ you cannot find it, make sure the menu item <span
class="menu">View<br>AllÂ Processes</span> is checked.)
</p><p>
There should be exactly one process left in the list.
Highlight it, then select
<span class="menu">View<br>Quit Process</span>
from the menu, and click <span class="menu">Quit</span>
in the popup prompt.
The Taskgate process will be terminated and, consequently, should
disappear from the list.
InÂ aÂ few seconds, it will be restarted by the system and should
reappear in the list. Please wait for this to happen (it may take up to
aÂ minute or two, at worst).
</p><p>
Finally, in aÂ Terminal window, run
<code>codesign -s gdbcert /usr/local/bin/gdb</code>
(if you named your certificate differently, replace
<code>gdbcert</code> with its name here).
Once again, you will be prompted for you username and password.
If the command does not produce any output, then GDB is
successfully signed.
</p>

<h2 id="eclipse">Configuring Eclipse</h2>
<p>
The only thing left to do is to point Eclipse to the GDB executable.
Open <span class="menu">Eclipse<br>Preferences</span> from the
main menu (not to be confused with
<span class="menu">Project Preferences</span>).
In the tree of options listed in the sidebar, navigate to
<span class="menu">C/C++<br>Debug<br>GDB</span>, and set
the <span class="menu">GDBÂ debugger</span> field to
<code>/usr/local/bin/gdb</code>.
</p><p>
If there is no <span class="menu">GDB</span> section
in the <span class="menu">C/C++<br>Debug</span> subtree,
close the preferences window, and try to first start a debugging
session for any project that you can already run without problems.
You can do it by either clicking the <span class="menu">Debug</span>
button on the toolbar, or selecting <span class="menu">Run<br>Debug</span>
from the main menu.
This attempt will, of course, fail with an error message about
the <code>gdb</code> command, but it will force
the said <span class="menu">C/C++<br>Debug<br>GDB</span>
settings to appear in the preferences.
</p><p>
This will change the GDB executable for new projects; for all existing
ones (that you are going to use debugging for), you will need to
manually update their debug configurations.
To do that, select
<span class="menu">Run<br>Debug Configurations</span>
from the menu.
InÂ theÂ window that appears, one after another, select every project
under the <span class="menu">C++Â Application</span> section in
the sidebar.
For each of them, open the <span class="menu">Debugger</span> tab,
set the <span class="menu">GDBÂ debugger</span> field to the same path
<code>/usr/local/bin/gdb</code>, and click the
<span class="menu">Apply</span> button.
After repeating this change for all listed projects, click <span
class="menu">Close</span>.

If the above steps do not solve the issue on your machine, or you
encounter aÂ problem while following them, please do not hesitate to
come to one of the upcoming common labs for help.
