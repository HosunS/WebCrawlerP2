Marios Papaefthymiou is Professor of Computer Science and the Ted and
Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean of the Donald Bren School of
Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California,
Irvine.  He is also co-founder and Chief Scientist of Cyclos
Semiconductor, which specializes in design technologies for
energy-efficient processors.  His research addresses a broad spectrum
of problems in computer design with an emphasis on architectures and
design methodologies for energy-efficient high-performance processors.

<!--Together with his students, he has published several
invited and award-winning papers, including a Best Paper at the 2013
International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming
Languages and Operating Systems, a Best Paper at the 2012 IEEE
Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, a Best Paper at
the 1995 ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference, and a First Prize
paper in the VLSI Design Contest of the 2001 ACM/IEEE Design
Automation Conference.  Among other distinctions, Papaefthymiou has
received the Arthur Greer Memorial Prize from Yale College, the
Outstanding Achievement Award from the EECS Department at U. Michigan,
the Ted Kennedy Family Faculty Team Excellence Award from the College
of Engineering at U. Michigan, the Faculty Recognition Award from the
