<A NAME= "intro"><h2>Introduction:</h2></A>
I will be conducting research on the Jewish Holocaust. As an Armenian,
I am well aware of the Armenian Genocide of 1915, during whcih 1.5
million Armenians were slaughtered in Turkey. In the
beginnings of World War II, Hitler gave a speech to a group of military
men describing his plan for the "Final Solution" for the Jewish Question.
In that speech he said that the Nazi plan for the Jews would go
relatively unnoticed by the international community: Hitler asked
rhetorically, "Who remembers the Armenians?" Growing up in Skokie, Illinois,
a predominantly Jewish suburb, I came to understand how the Holocaust left an
indellible mark on the collective Jewish psyche, much like the Genocide
for the Armenians and slavery for African Americans. I would like to educate
myself on the historical facts surrounding the Holocaust by defining the
key terminology associated with the Holocaust and providing a 
historical overview of this period. Amidst revisionist writers who claim that the Holocaust never happened,
the need to learn the historical truth and pass it down is ever more
important. Thus, this paper will provide a historical road map of the
Holocaust and the experiences of those who endured and surived.

<h2> Why Study the Holocaust?</h2>
The Holocaust was a <A HREF="http://www.ushmm.org/education/guidelines.html">
watershed event</A> which was historically unprecedented in scope. It reveals 
the disastrous consequences of prejudice, racism, and social and political scapegoating that
are endemic in any society. The German example also shows that <A HREF= "
http://www.ushmm.org/education/guidelines.html">democratic institutions</A> are not
permanent political fixtures. Rather, they can be overturned, as did occur in Germany,  if 
citizens are not politically aware. By studying the Holocaust and the horrific effects this
historical event had on a certain contingent of society, we can  gain understanding
of past history in hopes of preventing the repetition of it.
<h1>Terms Used in this Paper</h1>
<h2>What is the Holocaust? </h2><p>
Although volumes of academic literature has been written on the Jewish Holocaust, 
a brief summary and definition of the <A HREF="http://www.ushmm.org/education/5quest.html>
Holocaust</A> is in order. The Holocaust was the destruction of some six million Jews
by the Nazis and their followers in Europe between the years 1933-1945. Other individuals
and groups suffered grievously such as homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and political dissidents
during this period. But only the Jews were marked
for complete and utter annihalation. The term Holocaust means literally <A 
HREF= "http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?holocaust">a completely
burned sacrifice</A>. It tends to suggest a sacrificial connotation to what occurred. 
The word Shoah, originally a Biblical term meaning widespread disaster, is the modern
Hebrew equivalent. The Holocaust was a state-sponsored, bureaucratized, and sytematic
extermination of European Jewry. The events surrounding the Holocaust occurred in two 
main historical phases: <A HREF="#history">1933-1939 and
1939-1945</A>.  

<h2> Who were the Nazis?</h2>
<A HREF="http://www.ushmm.org/education/5quest.html"> 
<p>"Nazi" </A> is a short term for the National Socialist German Workers Party. This was a 
right-wing political party originally established in  1919 primarily by unemployed German 
veterans of World War I. In January 1933, Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor of a coalition
cabinet. Hitler, who took office on January 30, 1933, immediately set up a dictatorship.
 In 1934, the chancellorship and presidency were united in the person of the 
Fuhrer.  The Nazi party ideology was strongly anti-Communist, antisemitic, racist,
nationalistic, imperialistic and militaristic. During this totalitarian period, all other
parties were outlawed and opposition was brutally suppressed. He ended German democracy 
and severely restricted basic rights such as freedom of personal and marital relations, 
freedom of speech, press and assembly. The Nazis even intervened in the bedroom and 
prohibited inter-racial marriage and sexual relations! Hitler and the Nazis succeeded in  
establishing  a brutal dictatorship that defined people by race and punished 
dissidents through a vicious reign of terror. This created an atmosphere of fear,
distrust and suspicion in which people betrayed their neighbors. This all helped the Nazis
to obtain control over social institutions such as the civil service, the 
educational system, churches, the judiciary, industry, business and other professions. </p>
According to Holocaust file, "The Nazi legacy was a vast empire of murder, pillage, and exploitation that had
affected every country of occupied Europe. The toll in lives was enormous. The full
magnitude, and the moral and ethical implications, of this tragic era are only now
beginning to be understood more fully" (click here for reference A <HREF=
"http://www.ushmm.org/education/history.html">Holocaust</A>


<h2>What were the concentration camps?</h2>
Immediately upon their assumption of power on January 30, 1933, the Nazis established 
concentration campus for the imprisonment of all "enemies" of their regime: actual and
potential political opponents including communists, socialists, bolsheviks, gypsies, 
homosexuals, and other asocials. Beginning in 1938, Jews were targeted for internment solely
because they were Jews. Before then, only Jews that fit one of the earlier categories
were interned in campus. The first three concentration campus established were Dachau 
(near Munich), Buchenwald (near Weimar) and Sachsenhausen (near Berlin).
<A HREF= "http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/holocaust.auschwitz.part01.html">
Auschwitz </A> became
the most notorious of concentration camps. It was both a labor and extermination camp in
upper Silesia, Poland, 37 miles west of Krakow. Established in 1940 as a concentration camp, it became 
an extermination center in 1942.  Forced labor,
medical experimentation, along with extermination were the goals of the camps.
The Auschwitz extermination procedure evolved in stages. "In April 1942,
      Slovak Jews were gassed in Crematorium I, apparently with their
      clothes on.  Later, deportees from nearby Sosnowiec were told
      to undress in the yard.  The victims, faced by the peremptory
      order to remove their clothes, men in front of women and women
      in front of men, became apprehensive.  The SS men, shouting at
      them, then drove the naked men, women and children into the gas
      chamber"(click here for reference <A HREF= "http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/holocaust.auschwitz.part01.html"
>Auschwitz</A>). 
<A NAME="history"><h1> Historical Overview</h1></A>
The first measures taken by the Nazis against the Jews began in 1933. On April 1 of this year, the 
Nazis organized a boycott of Jewish shops and businesses by the Nazis. Later that week, the law for
the Re-establishment of the Civil Service expelled all non-Aryans (defined as anyone with a Jewish
parent or grandparent) from the civil service. Initially, exceptions were made for those working
since August 1914, German veterans of WWI, and those who had lost a father or son fighting for Germany
or her allies in WWI. Later on in the same year, Jews were prohibited from becoming practicing
lawyers, physicians, civil servants, and academics. Jewish enrollment in German high schools also
was limited to 1.5% of the student body. Jews were forced into creating their own schools and 
subculture away from mainstream Germany in order to survive. 

As mentioned earlier, the events of the Holocaust can be categorized historically in <A HREF=
"http://www.ushmm.org/education/history.html"> two main phases</A>.
<OL>
<LI> From <B>1933-1939</B>, the politics
of daily German life took a distinctly anti-Jewish slant. During this time period, intermittent
attacks on invidual Jewish businesses and people, as well as the institutionalization of 
racism took place. Beginning in 1933, laws were put into place that essentially excluded Jews
from the economy. They could no longer work in a vast array of professions and could not own
their own businesses in many districts. Thus, the Nazis succeeded their legal channels of slowly
marginalizing the Jewish community and disarming them of their property, money, and influence in
society. 
<LI> From <B>1939-1945</B> instituted the second phase of the Holocaust. On September 1, 1939, Germany
 invaded Poland and World War II began. Within
days, the Polish army was defeated and the Nazis began their campaign to destroy
those non-Aryans whom they viewed as "subhuman." This second phase was characterized by the
same racist ideology as the earlier period with one main difference. After 1939, the racism and
intermittent harassment of Jews became more serious and bureaucratized. No longer were just
a few Jews that the SS found displeasing harassed, but the whole Jewish population in Germany.
Ghettos were set up in order that Germans could "relocate" Jews in their own quarters within
Germany. During this period, camps were set up and 6 million Jews ultimately killed. The war ended
in 1945 and brought some, but not all, Nazi war criminals to justice through the Nuremberg Trials.
