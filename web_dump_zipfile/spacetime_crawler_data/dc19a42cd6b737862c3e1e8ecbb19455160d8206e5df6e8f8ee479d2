<h1>   
Efficient Search on Encrypted Data
</h1>
<h2> Ali Bagherzandi, UC Irvine </h2>

<p>
Abstract: 
Search on encrypted data has been focus of research both in database and
cryptography communities. Traditionally the results in cryptography
community provide strong security guarantees: typically hiding everything
but user's access pattern to the server. However, the server needs to scan
the whole database for each query, which yields unacceptably-slow
performance for practical databases.  In contrast, research from database
community, provides encryption schemes with efficient and optimized
indexing and flexible query support for various data types. But,
unfortunately, the security of these schemes is far less clear.

<p>
In this talk we will give an overview of a new line of research in
cryptography community that tries to narrow this gap. The results in this
category mostly investigate the best security guaranties for an encryption
scheme which also enables sub-linear (typically logarithmic) search.
We will in particular discuss deterministic and order preserving
encryption schemes which enable privacy-preserving search for exact-match and
range queries respectively with almost the same efficiency of search over
un-encrypted data.
