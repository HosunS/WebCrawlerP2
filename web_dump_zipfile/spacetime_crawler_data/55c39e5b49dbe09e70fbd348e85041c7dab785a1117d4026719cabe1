    <p class='phone'>Norm proposes to cancel 12 and 19 May</p>

    <h3 id="item04">Processor profiles discussion</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I haven't got anything new,
    but given that I'm canceling two week's meetings I thought we
    should have a meeting.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> I'd like to observe a
    logical inconsistency that keeps happening. Some time ago, XML
    was developed. Lots of folks are using angle bracket stuff that
    isn't really XML and calling it XML.<br />
    ... You could fork on the standalone attribute. It seems to me
    that since this is the XML Processing Model WG, we should have
    a profile that does XML.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Some discussion of what exactly is out there
    (HTML excepted) that's called XML that isn't well formed.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Ok, then I think a profile
    that does DTD validation would satisfy you, yes?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> I think so.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> We talked about DTD
    validation several months ago and decided against it. I'm not
    immediately persuaded to go that way now.<br />
    ... There was some sentiment that we shouldn't be encouraging
    DTDs.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> But we're the XML
    Processing Model WG. We should either go back and say that XML
    should change or we should support validation. All I'm saying
    is that as we traveld own this road, we keep dropping things.
    There are probably lots of reasons to do that, but it just
    occurs to me that this is XML processing and one of the things
    you can do is validation.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> I suppose having a profile
    that does validation is a logical profile.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> I think there's a sort of
    cross product. I'm not sure that validation could be added to
    several of these profiles.<br />
    ... The profiles as they stand are necessarily nested within
    each other. If we define a further one, which is one of them
    plus validation, the question arises what about adding it to
    the others.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Henry, if you're willing to
    look at the spec costs, that would be good.<br />
    ... It probably only makes sense to add validation to the
    profile that reads the external subset.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Why? There are documents
    that carry their DTDs in their internal subset.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Hmm. Yeah.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Murray asks about profiles that have optional
    steps.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> We don't really have
    those, that would have a high cost.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> If you're using DTDs,
    you're in a particular world. I don't think we can necessarily
    satisfy everyone out there.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> Maybe we could try to
    satisfy just a subset of that world: DTDs without namespaces,
    for example.</p><a name="action01" id="action01"></a>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt;
    <strong>ACTION:</strong> Henry to review the spec to see what
    the cost would be of adding validation. [recorded in <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2011/05/05-xproc-minutes.html#action01">http://www.w3.org/2011/05/05-xproc-minutes.html#action01</a>]</p>

    <p class='phone'>Norm mentions that XInclude is no longer in
    the profiles per the 21 April discussion.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> Hey, I need XInclude for
    GRRDL.<br />
    ... I wonder whether the name of the profile could be more
    descriptive of what it includes. So "browser's in 2011", "xml
    valid", etc.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Yeah, Recommended was
    probably a mistake.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Alex:</cite> I agree. I think we really
    should have a profile that's intended for web browsers.<br />
    ... that has the word "Browser" in the title.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Some discussion of XML in browsers...</p>

    <p class='phone'>Some discussion of whether there should be a
    profile for what each of the browsers do.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> Possibly in non-normative
    appendixes.<br />
    ... I'd like a chance to think about this offline.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Norm:</cite> Let's take this up again at
    the next meeting.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> And getting XInclude
    back.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> We also need to reply to
    comments.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Murray:</cite> We have WG meetings in
    Toronto preceding Balisage. Would anyone like to have a f2f in
    between?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Henry:</cite> Not sure I could go.</p>

    <h3 id="item05">Any other business?</h3>

    <p class='phone'>None heard.</p>

    <p class='phone'>Adjourned</p>
