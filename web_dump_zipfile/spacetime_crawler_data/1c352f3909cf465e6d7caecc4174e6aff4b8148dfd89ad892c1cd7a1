<UL><LI><font size="+1"><B>Eleazar (Louis)</B></FONT> (1875 - 1933) came to the USA in 1888. He was married to Fanny (Feige Devorah), daughter of Lieb and Lena Bair, and they lived in the Bronx. Fanny was about 59 when she passed away on January 13, 1939. She is buried at Mount Hebron cememtery in Flushing, NY (Ohave Sholom - Block 2) with her husband. They had seven known children according to the Langsam-Spira book. Only 3 seem to have survived to adulthood (although a check in the NY death records from 1888 - 1934 did not turn up the other 4 names).
