        <b class="popupTitle">Course Project of Computer Vision In Smart Environments</b><br><br>
        Computer Vision In Smart Environments was an optional graduate course, from electrical engineering department, by Dr Hamid Aghajan.<br>
        The project was a joint work alongside my friend Amir Alam.<br>
        Our Project was to detect the human foreground image in each frame from camera input and place it properly in a 3d environment,
        and let the user in the video interact with the 3d environment in real time.<br>
        We provided a lamp in the virtual scene which the user could interact with, and change the lighting of the entire scene
        including the user himself.
        Also the 3d shadow of user's image was shown properly.<br><br>
        In this project we used Unity3d game engine and the OpenCV library.<br><br>
        <!--<a href="https://youtu.be/JWRGCc0EHCI" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Video of the project</a><br><br>-->

    <div class="popup" id="CGProject">
        <b class="popupTitle">Course Project of Computer Graphics</b><br><br>
        In this course first we had to make a 3d scene in a room consisting a window and optionally a chair and a clock using pure legacy OpenGL.
        Picture blow shows the above mentioned room. This room has no external resources and everything, including the models and textures, are computer generated using only simple features of OpenGL consisting only triangle and line draw calls.

        <br><br>
        In the next phases of the project we worked with modern OpenGL, and included GLSI programming and tried to provide user interaction in the scene.

        <br>
        <br>
        Final phase included realistic and properly placing textures and implementing Phong illumination model and other CG techniques to provide a better scene.
        <br>
        This project was made with c++.

        This project is a hotel reservations system. Users are either hotel managers or normal users. Hotel managers can add/edit/delete hotels or rooms through their account. Normal users are able to search for rooms specifying required information. I also added a recommender system using collaborative filtering algorithm.

        This system is written in Python. We used django framework as web server.
