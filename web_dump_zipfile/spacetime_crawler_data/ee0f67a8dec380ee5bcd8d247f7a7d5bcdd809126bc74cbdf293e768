Graphical models are widely used to model complex interactions between 
variables.
A graphical model contains many functions over these variables which have an 
underlying graph structure and represents an overall joint function composed 
of these functions.
Examples include Bayesian networks, Markov networks, and weighted constraint 
satisfaction problems.
In these, a common query is the optimization query, which is to find a joint 
configuration of variables that optimizes the objective function defined by 
the joint function.

<p>
One of the best frameworks for these queries is the AND/OR search framework, 
which casts this optimization problem as a heuristic search problem.
AND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) and AND/OR Best-First (AOBF) search are both 
algorithms that search the AND/OR search space, which exploits conditional 
independencies in a problem.
The performance of these algorithms are highly dependent on the strength of 
its heuristics, which is the main focus of this thesis.

<p>
We first investigate the well-known technique of look-ahead, commonly used in 
search applications such as games, adapting it to the optimization task in 
graphical models.
In particular, we analyze the typically used MBE heuristic within the AND/OR 
search framework, establishing a connection between the ``bucket error'' of 
MBE 
and the residual.
This connection enables a cost-effective scheme that allows look-ahead to be 
selectively performed only where it is likely to have a positive impact on 
the heuristic.
An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that we are able to improve 
the power of AND/OR Branch-and-Bound.

<p>
Second, in seeking an anytime scheme for providing lower bounds on the 
optimal solution, we explore the impact of subproblem ordering on AOBF.
Our analysis demonstrates that this can significantly impact the performance 
of AOBF for both exact and anytime solutions.
We propose heuristics based on the bucket error of MBE and demonstrate their 
potential.

<p>
Third, to tackle problems where MBE is known to perform poorly on, we explore 
dynamic heuristics that are computed during search rather than static 
heuristics which are pre-computed such as with MBE.
We adapt the FGLP algorithm, a coordinate-descent method for a linear 
programming relaxation-based bound on the objective, for use a a heuristic 
generator for AOBB.
Through a re-derived update method and a defined update schedule, we 
demonstrate the advantage of FGLP heuristics on problems known to be 
difficult when using MBE.

<p>
Additionally, we extend AND/OR Multi-valued Decision Diagrams, a framework 
for the compact representation of functions in graphical models.
We provide a previously missing empirical evaluation of previously introduced 
methods.
We also extend the framework to allow for exact bucket elimination to be 
implemented using AOMDDs, thus pushing the feasibility of bucket elimination 
on problems that normally require an infeasible amount of memory.
