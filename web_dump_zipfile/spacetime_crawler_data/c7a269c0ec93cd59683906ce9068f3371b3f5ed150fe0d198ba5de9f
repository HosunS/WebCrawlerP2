<UL><LI><font size="+1"><B>Edward - Yitzchok in Hebrew</B></FONT> (April 03, 1870 - June 11, 1932) was married twice. His first wife, Katie Keurfung, bore him two children before passing away at the age of 31 on June 16, 1901. Edward remarried a widow, Rosie Cohen Eichner, that same year (she passed away April 14, 1963). He had 2 additional children with her. Edward naturalized in 1892, while living at 57 Lewis Street, in NYC. He later moved to 319 8th Street in NYC. By 1908 he resided in Boston with his wife and children. Based on various records, it appears he was a barber by trade, both in NYC and Boston.
