<P><B>Performance Appraisal due with each Deliverable</B></P>

<P>Please turn in no later than the first class period after the due date.</P>

<P>For each team member other than the manager, the following appraisals
form must be filed with each deliverable. Note that this form is to be
done in a three step process. First, the team member (non-manager ) must
fill out part I; second, the manager must fill out part II, while the team
member fills out part II; thrid, the manager reads and signs part III,
while the team member reads and signs part II. In part I, the team member
will describe her /his own responsibilities, accomplishments and potential
improvement. In part II, the manager will review the team member's appraisal
and rate her/his performance. In part III, the team member will rate the
manager's performance. The purpose of the three steps is so that both team
member and manager know how they are being rated. You should be honest
<B>without </B>being vengeful. Keep in mind that a bad rating in many of
the indeces is not indicaative of a poor performance and will certainly
not relfect in your grade. Note that <B>all </B>appraisals should cover
only the phase in question. Please hand in all appraisal forms with your
deliverable. You will be marked down only for failing to fill out appraisals
(either team member or manager ), handing in illegible forms, or giving
too little detail.</P>
