Hi Moishe,
     
I had a few copies of the book a few years ago, and would love to get my 
hands on some more.  We are indeed cousins...
     
Please let me know how I can obtain the book again - I don't know if I am in 
any updates or not yet, but my side of the family was most recently from the 
Bronx - an uncle, Ralph Langsam, first mentioned it to me.  I remember 
tracing my roots to RASHI of biblical times...
     
talk to you soon,
Robert

my grandmother's name is Bertha (Betty), my father had no siblings.  I've 
got an aunt Ann that lives in Ct.  She was my grandfather's sister.  My 
cousin's name is Amy.
     
Somehow I know I am related to Ralph Langsam, biggest landlord of the Bronx, 
now residing in Palm Beach Gardens, FL.
     
Let me know my friend...

Moishe,

I am sending you material from two folders:  one with immigration records that
Estelle and I collected over a number of years and the other with death
records.

I have Morris' death record.  It does not have his place of birth outside of
Austria.  In fact, I have rarely seen a NY death record with a town of birth.
Such information is generally confined to immigration records (both ship and
naturlization) and sometimes in the the 1920 census.  Naturalizations after
1906 were supposed to have the town of birth.

Remember the cigar guy cousin?  Never got anything from him worth all
the words, but I think  that his family was the Pesach and Bessie nee
Schector.  The Raphael was, I believe, his grandfather.

anyway, look for the package I'm sending.  It's the tip of the iceberg.  If
you could come here for a week, we could wrap this puppy up!  Just kidding.

Suzan
