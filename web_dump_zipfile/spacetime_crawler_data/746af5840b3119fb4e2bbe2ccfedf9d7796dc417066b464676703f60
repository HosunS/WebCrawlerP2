<h3> To add the course </h3>
</div>

As of this writing, the class has lots of room. See the section below that applies to you (regular UCI student or Access student) for details on how to add the course.</p>

 <p><i>Even after to apply to add the course, it can still take a while to become officially enrolled. While waiting for official enrollment, you should still participate in the course.</i> Due dates for new adds are the same as other students, so if you do not keep up with the work, you will be at a serious disadvantage. Come to lecture; do the readings; work on the assignments.  Yes, there is an extremely low chance that you will do the work and still not be allowed to enroll, but we do not al all expect that to happen.</p>

<h4>Regular UCI Students</h4>

<p>Through Friday of week 3, to add this course, put yourself to the wait list for it via WebReg. The registration system will add you into the course when there is an opening, and will send you email (to your UCInetID) to let you know you have been added.</p>

<p>If you are on the waitlist and decide you do not want to be added, do remove yourself from it.</p>

<p>For more information about how course wait lists work, see <a href="http://www.reg.uci.edu/enrollment/waitlistoption.html">the Registrar's Waitlist Option web page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to add the course after Friday of week 3, you use the on-line Enrollment Exceptions system to request to add the course. The instructor, the Dean of the school of your major and the Dean of the Bren School (if different) all must approve the request for it to be granted. <p><i>Email the instructor that you have filed a petition.</i>: The Exceptions system does not notify the instructor when you request to add, even when the instructor&#146;s approval is required.</p>

<p>For information on accessing the Enrollment Exceptions system and other details, visit the <a href="http://www.reg.uci.edu/enrollment/adc/exceptions.html">Enrollment Exceptions Web page</a>.
</p>

<h4> ACCESS Students</h4>

<p>Access students can also add the course through Friday of week 3; see the instructor with your Access enrollment form in hand. (You cannot add the class via WebReg.) Access students will be added, space permitting, after all regularly-enrolled UCI students.<br><br>

<h3>To drop the course</h3>
</div>

<p>Through Friday of Week 2, just go to WebReg to drop the course.</p>

<p>If you wish to drop the course after Friday of Week 2, use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request a drop; the Deans of the Bren School and of your major must approve it. <i>Do note: Not doing well in a course is not an accepted reason for droppping it after Friday of Week 2, and your drop request will almost certainly be denied.</i>Deans, <i>not the instructor</i>, decide whether to grant the request.</p>


<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3>To change your grading status</h3>
</div>

<p>...to pass/not pass or back again: Through Friday of Week 2, just go the WebReg and make the change. After Friday of Week 2, use the Enrollment Exceptions system to request the change; again, Deans, not the instructor, decide whether to grant the request.
