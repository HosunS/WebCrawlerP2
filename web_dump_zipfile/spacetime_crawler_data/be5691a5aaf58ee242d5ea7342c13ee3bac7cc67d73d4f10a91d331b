<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h5>8. Indemnity</h5>

<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold CBSi and all of its officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, information providers, service providers, vendors, contractors, affiliates, partners, and licensors (collectively, the &#8220;<strong>CBSi Parties</strong>&#8221;) harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneysâ€™ fees) incurred by any of the CBSi Parties in connection with any claim, including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, violation of rights of publicity or privacy, copyright infringement, or trademark infringement arising out of: your use of the Application; any use or alleged use of your account or your passwords by any person, whether or not authorized by you; your connection to CBSiâ€™s or its vendorsâ€™ servers; your violation of this Agreement; or your violation of the rights of any other person or entity.Â  CBSi reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify CBSi, and you will cooperate with CBSiâ€™s defense of these claims.</p>

<h5>9. Termination.</h5>

<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.Â  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by: (i) irretrievably erasing, deleting, or destroying all copies of the Application in your possession or control; and (ii) ceasing to use the Services and Content available through the Application.Â  CBSi may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.Â  However, if you paid CBSi or its authorized Distribution Channel to acquire the Application, and we terminate this Agreement within one year after you made your payment for reasons other than your breach of this Agreement or the CBSi Terms, we will refund a prorated portion of the purchase price corresponding to the portion of such one year period for which our action caused you not to be able to use the Application.Â  Upon termination for any reason, the license granted in Section 4 will immediately terminate.Â  The provisions in Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 will survive any termination.</p>

<h5>10. Export Controls.</h5>

<p>You will not ship, transfer, or export the Application into any country or use the Application in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Export Laws</strong>&#8221;).Â  You represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of, and are not located within, a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &#8220;terrorist supporting&#8221; country, and that you are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the Application.</p>

<h5>11. Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction.</h5>

<p>This Agreement and all claims arising from or related to your use of the Application will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except Californiaâ€™s conflict of law rules.Â  This Agreement and the Application will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.</p>

<p>With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Application or this Agreement within one year after such claim or action accrued. Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action.</p>

<h5>12. Disputes; Arbitration</h5>

<p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates (a &#8220;<strong>Claim</strong>&#8221;) arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement, and the claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (877) 814-7002, you and we each agree to resolve such disputes through an individual binding arbitration or an individual action in small claims court.Â  Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other personâ€™s claim.Â  You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.Â  This Section 12 shall survive termination of this Agreement or any subscription that you may have to receive Content.</p>

<p>Before you commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to your Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your claim (&#8220;<strong>Notice</strong>&#8221;).Â  The Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 Attn: Legal Department; (3) describe the nature of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.Â  If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of your Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>

<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, if applicable (the &#8220;<strong>Rules</strong>&#8221;).Â  Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.Â  In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will, at your request, take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.Â  For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.Â  If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than CBS Interactiveâ€™s last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, CBS Interactive will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>

<h5>13. Miscellaneous.</h5>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements, provided, however, that this Agreement will coexist with the CBSi Terms and any Additional Terms.Â  To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement conflict with the CBSi Terms, this Agreement will govern.Â  We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain events.Â  You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you via email, if you have provided it to us.Â  If you do not provide us with accurate information or we do not have access to your email address, we will not be responsible for failure to notify you.Â  If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable, except as expressly stated.Â  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.Â  Except as otherwise required by law, the controlling language of this Agreement is English.Â  This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.Â  You and we acknowledge and agree that the Distribution Channel and its subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you.</p>
