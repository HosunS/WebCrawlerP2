Here is a typical inquiry letter that I and several cousins have<br>
used in contacting Langsams. We got addresses mainly from phonebooks.<br>
For some of the people, we already had partial information.<br>
We made a spanish translation for south america which paid off.<br>
We got something like a 35% response rate. An important point in<br>
such a letter is to provide a lot of info so that the recipient<br>
knows that this is not one of "those ripoffs". Also, important<br>
to include a stamped envelope! BTW any Langsams out there - feel<br>
free to write. MMC<br> <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Langsam Cousin,<br> 
<br>
 I am representing a group of cousins who are working on a family history<br>
project and we would like to involve you in the project. After a number<br>
of years of research, we have found that most of the Langsams alive today<br>
are related through a man named Pesach Langsam who lived during the last<br>
half of the 18th century in a village in Galicia. The name of the town was<br>
Yawornik (now in Poland). The Austrian government ruled over the area from<br> 1772 until after World War I. Austria insisted that all people under its<br>
rule have last names and so, during Pesach's adulthood, he was apparently<br>
compelled to adopt a last name. Registration was generally handled on a town<br>
by town basis by officials appointed to handle this process. As most of you<br>
know, Langsam means slowly in German. We suspect that Pesach did not move<br>
quickly enough for an impatient official and was consequently dubbed Langsam.<br> 
<br>
Although the name of Pesach's wife has been lost, we do know that she was<br>
descended from a long line of distinguished rabbis and scholars through<br>
her mother's family. This is a facinating collection of ancestors that<br>
extends back with certainty to Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, also known as<br>
Rashi, who lived in Troyes, France in the 11th and 12th centuries.<br> 
<br>
We are now compiling a book for family use that outlines our common ances-<br>
toral lines and would be glad to share a copy with anyone who is interested.<br> 
<br> Meanwhile, back to Pesach and his wife. They had many children but some<br>
died young. We know about 5 of his sons. What we are trying to do is place<br>
as many Langsams as possible with one of those sons or identify other lines<br>
of descent. Please examine the following information carefully and then<br>
answer the enclosed questionaire. We have enclosed a stamped envelope in<br>
this letter for your convienence.<br> __________________________________________________________________________<br> 
<br>
Pesach Langsam of Yavornik b about 1740<br> +<br>
Niece of Rabbi Elimelech of Lisensk d 1786<br>
__________________________|_________________________________<br> | | | | |<br>
Shabti David Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech Efraim Shmuel Chaim Lieb<br>
1783-1841 1783-1830<br> 
<br>
1) Shabti had at least one son: Avraham Abba, who, in turn had at least<br>
one son, Pesach David from Malczow. This man had the last name of<br>
Miller, probably due to restrictive marriage laws imposed by the <br>
Austrian government. When a civil marriage did not occur, the children<br>
had to be known by the mother's name and only the eldest son could<br>
legally marry for quite a number of years. However, there is much<br>
evidence that there were also Langsam descendents from this line.<br> 
<br>
2) David had a son Pesach, who lived over a hundred years. Pesach married<br>
a cousin from the Spira line and also someone else. His children were<br>
Shimon of Meilitz, Nacha, Sholem of Lancut, Meir of Bircza, and Ita.<br>
We have identified descendents of all these children except Nacha.<br> <br>
3) Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech (Spira) of Dynow was a famous hasidic rebbe who<br>
took the name Spira. All of Tzvi Elimelech's sons continued using that<br>
name. We know a graet deal about this family.<br> <br>
4) For Ephriam Shmuel we have identified only one line. He seems to have<br>
had a son Pesach who married Sarah Miriam Tscherlit. They lived in<br>
Blazowa which is a larger town near Yavornik. My great-great grand-<br>
father Chaim Efriam Shmuel, born about 1830 was their son. He married<br>
Miriam Landesman and they had five children, all but one of whom has<br>
descendents in the US. We believe we know about all the descendents<br>
of Chiam Efraim Shmuel, but there may have been other siblings.<br>
<br>
5) Chaim Leib 1783-1830 lived in Blazowa and had 3 children: Menachem<br>
Mendel, Mirel,and Yosef Yehuda. Mirel married Yehishua Fish of Dynow.<br>
The Fish family is well documented. The family of Yosef Yehuda still has<br>
many holes for us. We know of 6 children: Asher Zelig who married Roiza<br>
(many descendents in Israel), Efriam (who went to the US, no further<br>
certain knowledge), Nosson Dov Ber (dtr Hannah has descendents in<br>
Israel, dtr Golda, son Tzvi Hirsh of Vienna, and 2 other sons, one of<br>
whom came to US), Berish (son Zalman), Golda, Tzvi Elimelech of Lancut<br> (son Aaron came to US, son Yakov and dtr Miriam have descendents in<br>
Israel).<br>
<br>
Menachem Mendel of Bukowsk, 1834-1915 had 13 children and perhaps 2<br>
wives. The children were Avraham of Przemysl, Gittel mar Eleazar Fischel,<br>
Pessia mar Ginsberg, Esther mar Lippe Frank, Jacov Josef of Kanczuga mar<br>
Chaya Sura, Channah Mindel mar Chaim Stern of Bukowsk (children took<br>
Langsam name), Yosef of Bukowsk and Dukla mar Hannah, David mar Beila<br>
Orum, Chaim Leib, Ita mar Josef Roth of Sanok, Hinde mar Areh Leib Fish,<br>
Chaya mar Issac Gottlieb of Pruchnik, and Miriam mar Tuvia Rand of<br> Bukowsk.<br>
<br> From the five known sons of Pesach Langsam of Yavornik we know of about 1400<br>
descendents. We also have information on a number of other families which we<br>
suspect are connected to Pesach but we lack confirming evidence. Among these<br>
families are: Mendel Langsam mar Sarah both born about 1853 lived at 82<br>
Columbia in 1900 (many descendents in US known), Meilach Langsam of Kanczuga<br> mar Golda, Etka Langsam of Pruchnik, Mayer Langsam of Linsk mar Feiga Suss-<br>
fein, Aaron Langsam of Sanok mar Molly, Mayer Langsam of Sienawa, brothers<br>
Yehoshua Chaim and Shoel Shrager Langsam (many descendents in US), Isaac ben<br>
Saul 1857-1924 mar Gittel 1857-1923 had 8 children (many lawyers and doctors<br>
among descendents in NY area), and quite a few more. So, even if we can not<br>
connect your family immediately to Pesach of Yavornik, we may have consider-<br> able information.<br>
<br>
Please return the enclosed questionaire and help us put the rest of<br>
the puzzle pieces together!<br>
<br>
Best Wishes,<br>
<br>
