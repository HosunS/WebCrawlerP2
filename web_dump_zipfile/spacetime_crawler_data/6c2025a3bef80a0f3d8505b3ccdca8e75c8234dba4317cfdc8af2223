Hello

          I am working on my family tree and I was told that somewhere on
 your site the Miller family links to the Ecksteins, who somehow relate
to me.  Can you please reffer me to the page where you establish this link?

Thanks,

             Ari

Hi,
   Thanks for the URL.  I checked it out and it really didn't mean anything
to me.  You see, I am at the very beginning of my Genealogy journey and I
was referred to you by an uncle by the name of Avery Friedman.  He said that
the Eckstein's from your family tree link to ours, I still
don't know how, but it's another bit of information for me (I'm still in the
stage of gathering information).

Hi,
So now I know who you are. I would like to work with you on this, if its
OK with you. I have a lot of material on Avery's branch. How are you related
to him (exactly). Do you live in Brooklyn? Do you speak Yiddish (we have
an Eckstein cousin in Monroe with a lot of detail. I spoke with him a few
times).

Great, I would like to work with you on this, unfortunately I must return
now to my IDF army base, so I will only be home in a week, perhaps two.
I'll write back then.



All of the best,

I will work on the list over the next few weeks. I think I'm ready to get
back into the geneology business, so I appreciate the e-mail prompt.(I had
a fire in my house and am first settling back in now.)


I'm curious where you got the two CCs from.


Have a happy.

Hi,
To answer your question "I'm curious where you got the two CCs from" maybe you 
can tell me about the first one. The second one in an Eckstein I met at a Bar 
Mitzvah whose father is Tzvi Elimelech. No known connection, but I am hoping we 
can find one.

Sorry to hear about the fire. Hope your yom tov makes it a little better.

Hello!

I came across your very fine genealogy and I believe that we have a common
ancestor.

My name is Barbara Jean Greil (nee Eckstein)and my great-grandfather was the
Yosef Shlomo Eckstein mentioned in your genealogy.  What you may not know is
that Chava Rosner was Yosef Shlomo's 2nd wife.  He was briefly married to
another woman, possibly by the name of Lya? and they were divorced.  They
did have a son, my grandfather, (Zvi Aliemelech ben Josef Shlomo known as
Herman) who lived in Cluj Romania (was Hungary before WWI and called
Kolozsvar or Klausenberg.)  Herman married Emma Levy, came to the U.S. and
settled in Pittsburgh.  Emma came with their 7 children in 1926 and followed
him to Pgh.  My father, Alex Eckstein is one of those children.

I can provide you with alot of information about this part of the family and
quite a bit about the Rosner side as well.  I also have a second cousin in
the NYC area (Brooklyn, I believe) who has been working extensively on the
Eckstein/Rosner genealogy.  I just heard from him recently, which sparked my
interest in doing some research on the internet, which wasn't a factor when
we last corresponded in the 1980's!  With his permission, I will put you in
touch with him.

I am really impressed by your work! I have found alot of Eckstein
genealogies on the Internet, but none of them are Jewish.  Of course I am
just a "newbie" in all this.

Let me know if you would like me to give you more information.  I live in
upstate NY in the Village of Alfred.  My husband is a sociology professor at
Alfred University, and I am a librarian at the SUNY College of Technology at
Alfred.  My brother lives in New City, and my Aunt Irene (Eckstein) Kohn
lives on the Lower East Side, so I do get down to the city fairly often.
Maybe we can all get together sometime?

Regards, and hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks for your inquiry. I apologize for the delay but I was out of town the last 
two weeks. I will more fully answer your letter shortly. Do you have any of your 
family in GEDCOM (or Family Tree Maker) format?

Hi there-


I &lt;will get> back to you both on updates from my part of the Eckstein
family.  I do have some questions, though:


1. Re Moishe's question: Do you have any of your family in GEDCOM (or Family
Tree Maker) format?


No--I don't know what this is since I am a relative "newbie" at this.  I
think I have seen Family Tree Maker at Walmart.  Which product is better in
your view?


2.  I talked to my Dad about this recently, and he thinks there might be a
mistake with respect to Yosef Shlomo's wive(s).  You both have his wife
as"Chava Rosner."  According to my Dad, his grandfather's first wife was Lya
(sp??) Sternberger and they had one child, who was my grandfather Herman
Eckstein.  His hebrew name was not Hersh Melech, but Zvi Alemelech ben Yosef
Shlomo.  After Lya and Josef Sholomo were divorced, he married Harriet
Freidman and they had nine children.  The Rosner name comes into play
because Lya married a man named Morton Rosner and had 4 or 5 children whose
names I have and also those of their children, but not right in front of me
now.  I will get this info to you.  Now this is according to my father, who
said he got the information from my Uncle Albert, who was the keeper of the
family genealogy and was the oldest.  Of course he might just be confused
about all of this.  I will try to verify this with my cousins in Phoenix
(John and Paul Eckstein).  


Avery-  I saw Maurice Rucker and he said "Hi"


That's all for now.  Will be in touch soon.  Good Shabbos!

THIS IS CORRECT, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WAS STEINBERGER

THIS IS INCORRECT. I AM SURE THE SECOND WIFE WAS CHAVA ROSNER.THE ONLY
FRIEDMAN REFERENCE I HAVE IS TO YOSEF SHLOMO'S MOTHER RACHEL FRIEDMAN
The Rosner name comes into play

THIS PART IS ALSO CORRECT. MORTON ROSNER WAS A COUSIN OF SOME TYPE TO
CHAVA ROSNER. TWO OF MORTON/LYA'S CHILDREN MARRIED APPLBAUMS-WHICH IS THE
OTHER SIDE OF MY FAMILY SO I HAVE MOST OF THAT INFO BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE
WHAT YOU HAVE.

NO, HE'S GOT IT RIGHT

MOISHE:
I HAVE FINALLY HAD THE TIME TO REVISE YOUR LIST. THAT IS WHAT PROMPTED ME
TO CONTACT BARBARA. I WILL PUT IT IN THE MAIL TO YOU IN A FEW DAYS.
DID I GET FROM YOU (OR GIVE YOU)COPIES OF THE BOOKLETS BY MENACHEM MENDAL
ECKSTEIN? MINE WERE LOST IN THE FIRE, SO IF YOU HAVE THEM, I WOULD LIKE
COPIES.


BARBARA:
ANY INFO YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIRST COUSINS (OTHER THAN PAUL AND JOHN) AND
THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WOULD BE HELPFUL. THE ONLY PART OF THE
FAMILY I WAS EVER IN CONTACT WITH WAS YOU AND YOUR UNCLE ALBERT.


A BIRTH DATE FOR HERMAN WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL. THE ONE I HAVE (1887)
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IT HAD TO BE BEFORE 1884.

Hi there everyone-
 
Recently I have been in touch with a second cousin of ours, Avery
Horowitz, who my parents met many years ago in Brooklyn.  Over the years
he has been compiling an Eckstein genealogy and he recently got in touch
with me.  He would like to update his records about our part of the
family--births, marriages, deaths etc.  Any information you could provide
or corroborate would be greatly appreciated.

He would like the Hebrew and English names of your parents, of you and
your siblings, of your children, and their children if there are any.
Your birthplace and that of your parents and children, grandchildren,
would also be great.  Marriage and death dates are also important.
Anything you can provide would be terrific.

After hearing from Avery, I decided to look on the internet to see what
else I could find out about Ecksteins.  Lots of non-Jewish Ecksteins, but
I &lt;did> find an extensive genealogy to the Langsam, Miller, Spria,
Eckstein genealogy.  It seems as though we are related to these families.
I have been in touch with Moishe Miller, who is compiling this genealogy.
He has done a wonderful job, as has Avery.  Here is a link to Moishe's
work:  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam.htm
 
You may be wondering how we are related to Avery Horowitz.  I hope I get
this right!  His mother is Helen Applebaum Horowitz, and she is the
daughter of Goldie Eckstein Applebaum.  Goldie was one of the nine
children of our great-grandfather Yosef Shlomo Eckstein and Chava Rosner
(his second wife, according to Avery). Remember that Yosef Shlomo and our
great-grandmother Lya or Lia Sternberger or Steinberger had one child,
Herman, our grandfather, and then they divorced.  Therefore Avery and all
of us share the same great-great grandfather.  (A side note:  my Dad
believes that his grandfather's second wife was someone named Friedman,
because he remembers having cousins with the last name of Rosner.
According to Avery, this is because Lya, the first wife, married a cousin
of Chava's named Morton Rosner.  Just to make it  &lt;really> interesting,
two of Lya and Morton Rosner's daughters married two Applebaum brothers;
this is in addition to the fact that Avery's grandmother Goldie also
married a man named Applebaum.  I am not sure if &lt;these> Applebaums are
related)  If this seems confusing, believe me, it is!

I understand that Uncle Albert was also compiling information.  I am
hoping that we can all share this information.  Additional information
about grandfather Herman (his birthplace, date, marriage date(s), etc)
would be great.  Also, any information that anyone has on our great-great
grandfather Yosef Shlomo would be very important including birth/death
dates and places, his occupation.
 
If any of you have pictures of any of our ancestors it would be great to
create a digital archive.  I would be happy to scan any photographs and
post them to everyone.
 
Note:  I have a copy of the passenger manifest sheet from our parents voyage
on the SSRoosevelt in 1926.  If anyone wants a copy of this, I would be
happy to duplicate it and send it on.  (Carol, your copy will be in the mail
shortly.)


Hope you don't mind that I have contacted you this way, and I know this is
alot of work on your part.  Love and best wishes to all of you.
 
Love-

Cousin Barbara

This is my first cousin, who lives in Israel and is also working on
geneology. I'm not sure how he found your name and e-mail. 


I am putting a draft of the Eckstein family geneology in the mail to you.
