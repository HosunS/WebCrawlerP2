<h6> Course Description: </h6> 
Students in this project class will work in 2 to 3 person teams to develop 
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and apply them to a range of different 
problems related to natural language and text analysis. These problems can include, for example, document classification 
and clustering, sentiment analysis, dialog/chatbot systems, information extraction, word prediction, text synthesis, question-answering systems,
and so on. Projects can make use of real-world publicly-available data from sources such as Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, news articles, 
product and movie reviews, email data sets, the US patent database, and more.
</p>


<p>
<h6> <a href="https://piazza.com/uci/winter2018/compsci175/home">Piazza Class Website</a>: </h6>
We will use Piazza for questions, online discussion, announcements, etc.
 Please use the Piazza class forum as your first option for asking questions outside of class 
or office hours. Please also feel free to answer other students' questions, to initiate
discussions on project-related topics, etc. 
To communicate directly with only the instructor you can send a private message to the
instructor within Piazza.

<h6> Academic Integrity </h6> 
Please read the guidelines on academic integrity below. Academic integrity is taken seriously in this class. 
<ul>
<li> Failure to adhere to the policies below can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class.  
</li>
<li> <b>For assignments</b> you are allowed to discuss the assignments verbally with other class members, 
but you are not allowed to look at or to copy anyone else's written solutions or code. 
All problem solutions and code submitted must be material you have personally written during 
this quarter, except for any standard library or utility functions. </li>
<li> <b> For class projects</b> all reports submitted must be written by you or members of your project team. 
Code generated for class projects can be a combination of code written by team members and 
publicly-available code. You should clearly indicate in your reports and in your
code documentation which parts of your code was written by you or your team
and which parts of your code was written by others. </li> 
<li>  It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with 
<a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI's Academic Integrity Policies</a>
and
<a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/definitions.php"> UCI's definitions and examples of
academic misconduct</a>.
