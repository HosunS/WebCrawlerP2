<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><b>Pesach Langsam was the progenitor of our family. There is much mystery&nbsp; surrounding 
his heritage. Family lore has it that he was a direct descendant&nbsp; of Issachar, son of our 
patriarch, Jacob. Pesach Langsam's wife was a niece (through her mother) of the Rebbe, 
R. Elimelech of Lezajsk. His lineage is well known and traces back through RASHI's 
daughter, to King David. A book regarding his ancestry and offspring has been compiled 
by </b></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><b><a href="mailto:srwynne@erols.com">Suzan Wynne</a></b></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><b>. Her work, entitled The Langsam-Spira Family, is still available. Pesach 
Langsam died on November 2, 1820, at the age of 72. Regarding Pesach's earlier years, 
there is still much supposition. Even his wife's name is disputed. It was either Ita or 
Rochel Mina. One thing is for certain. At some point they lived in a small town in Galicia 
called Yawornik Polski. It is near Blazowa & Dynow. Pesach had 6 known children; five 
boys and one girl Our branch of the family is connected to Pesach Langsam . Hersh and 
Ruchel Langsam&nbsp; my grandparents lived in Blazova at the end of the 19th century.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="4">My parents Esther Leinhardt and Aharon Langsam came to Danzig (today, Gdansk) in the year 
1929 from their home town in Poland - Blazova. They were married December 1929. and I their 
first son Oscar Jehoshua was born January 1931. Life was good in those years, but became 
unbearable in 1934 when the Nazi Party in Danzig gained strength and Jews were being 
persecuted. Their second son Herman was born in 1937.</font> </p>

garrison on Westerplatte which controlled the entrance to the Danzig harbour and the 
city became part of the third Reich. Jews were being send to concentrations camps.&nbsp; My 
father Aharon had a chance to get on a illegal ship bound for Palestine with a group of 50 
men from Danzig, heads of Jewish families. On the boat were about 1300 Jewish men and 
women most of them from Austria fleeing from Nazi persecution. No one of them made it, 
the boat was detained in Yugoslavia and all the refugees were arrested by the Nazis after 
Germany occupied Yugoslavia. All 1300 men and woman were shot dead by the Nazis 
and buried in a mass grave in Sabac - Yugoslavia. After the war the bodies were exhumed 
and buried in the Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.</b></font> </p>

to flee. Finally we could leave with a group of 500 Danzig Jews in August 1940. This 
turned out to be the last Jews from Danzig who saved their lives. The group traveled by 
train to Bratislava and there boarded a Danube boat which brought us to Tulcea, a 
Rumanian port at the Black Sea. Here we boarded the ATLANTIC an old 500 ton Greek 
freighter together with 1600 Jews fleeing Europe. Three months later after a very 
dangerous and frustrating voyage we arrived in Haifa Palestine escorted by a British 
warship which had intercepted the freighter&nbsp; because it was trying to bring Jewish 
refugees to the shores of Palestine without the permission of the British Government.

<font size="4" color="#400040"><b><a href="oscar/maufacts.html">Mauritius</a></b></font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b> was still a British colony during World War II. In late December 1940,</b></font> <br>
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>1,580 Jews who had been seized by the British while trying to enter Palestine</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>"illegally" 
were taken to Mauritius; most of these refugees were interned in a camp</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>there until early 
August 1945.</b></font> <br>
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>In November of that year, three vessels reached the shores of Palestine, with more</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>than 
thirty - six hundred refugees on board from Danzig (Gdans'k) , Austria, and</b></font> 
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Czechoslovakia. They had begun their journey in Bratislava, Slovakia. At the</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Rumanian 
port of Tulcea, seven hundred boarded one of the ships, the Milos; over</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>one thousand, the 
Pacific; and nineteen hundred, the Atlantic.</b></font> <br>
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>The British received word of the three ships in early October, and on October 15th</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>the 
Colonial Office in London asked the governor of Mauritius whether he "could</b></font> 
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>accommodate, at short notice, a substantial number of Jews who were attempting</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>to enter 
Palestine illegally." The office added that the detention of the deportees</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>would require the 
building of a camp, to be surrounded by a barbed - wire fence,</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>that would be under 
permanent guard. In his reply, dated October 17, the governor</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>agreed to accept fifteen 
hundred refugees at once and another twenty - five</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>hundred within six months.</b></font> <br>
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>On November 1 the Pacific reached the shores of Palestine, followed, on November</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>3, by 
the Milos. Both ships were apprehended by the British coast guard and taken</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>to Haifa, 
where the passengers were kept on board for two weeks. They were then</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>transferred to 
another vessel, the Patria, which was being readied to take them to</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Mauritius. The 
Jewish Agency Executive in London discussed on November 11 the</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>British plan to deport 
the refugees to Mauritius. On November 20 Winston</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Churchill gave his consent to 
Colonial Secretary George Ambrose Lloyd's proposal</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>to deport the refugees, provided 
that they were treated decently; Churchill also</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>suggested that the decision be applied to 
future instances of refugees trying to enter</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Palestine illegally.</b></font> </p>
<p><font size="5" color="#400040"><b>The Sinking of the Patria.</b></font><font size="4"> </font><br>
<font size="4" color="#400040"><b>In Palestine, the High Commissioner refused to receive a delegation of the Asefat</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>ha - 
Nivharim (the elected assembly of Palestine Jewry), maintaining that the Jews</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>of 
Palestine were not authorized to deal with the affairs of Jews who were not</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>residents of 
the country. On November 24, the third vessel, the Atlantic, was</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>brought to Haifa by a 
British warship. That same evening, some of its passengers</b></font> <font size="4" color="#400040"><b>were</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>transferred to the 
Patria, with the rest scheduled to follow them the next day. On</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>the morning of November 
25, however, the underground Jewish army, the Hagana,</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>sabotaged the Patria so as to 
prevent the deportation, placing a small explosive</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>charge on the ship. Because the ship 
was old and rusty, a large hole opened up, and</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>within fifteen minutes the Patria sank and 
was lying on its side. Over 250 refugees</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>were listed as missing; most of them drowned, but 
a few apparently reached the</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>shore without being apprehended. Following public protests 
in Britain and the</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>United States, London instructed the Palestine authorities to permit the 
survivors</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>of the Patria to stay in the country. The rest of the Atlantic passengers, 
however,(including Esther with her son Oscar)</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>who had not been transshipped to the 
Patria, were deported on December 9 to</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>Mauritius, and arrived there on December 26. 
The order for their expulsion stated</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>that they were to be barred from entry into Palestine 
even when the war was over.</b></font><font color="#400040"> </font><font size="4" color="#400040"><b>MacMichael's successor as High Commissioner, Lord Gort,

to Palestine.</b></font> <br>
