<h1>CompSci 163/265, Spring 2016, Homework 2</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>(163 students:) Prove that the smallest and second-smallest
weight edges in an undirected graph are always both part of the minimum
spanning tree. (Hint: what does Kruskal's algorithm do with these
edges?)</p>
<p>(265 students:) Suppose that the vertices of a graph are colored
black and white. Define an edge to be white if both its endpoints are
white, black if both its endpoints are black, and gray if it has one
black and one white endpoint. The blue rule shows that the smallest gray
edge is always part of the minimum spanning tree. Is the second-smallest
gray edge also always part of the minimum spanning tree? If so, prove
it. If not, find an example where it is not.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the smallest and largest possible numbers of rounds that
Boruvka's algorithm can take to compute the minimum spanning tree of an
eight-vertex connected graph? (Here a "round" means that each spanning
tree in the current forest finds its smallest outgoing edge, and all
these edges are added to the forest. As usual, we assume that there are
no two edges with equal weights.) Give an example of an eight-vertex
graph that uses the smallest possible number of rounds, and another
eight-vertex graph that uses the largest possible number of
rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>The red rule can be used to prove the correctness of a "backwards
Kruskal" algorithm that sorts the edges in descending order by weight
and then loops through the edges in that order, deleting any edge that
belongs to a cycle in the remaining graph. To test whether an edge
belongs to a cycle, we can use depth first search to look for a path
that does not go through the edge but connects its endpoints. What is
the running time of this algorithm, including both the time for the
sorting step and the time to do a depth first search for each edge?
Express your answer in $O$-notation, as a function of $n$, the number of
vertices, and $m$, the number of edges. (This algorithm is described in
Wikipedia as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-delete_algorithm">reverse-delete
algorithm</a> but the analysis on Wikipedia uses different variable
names and a more sophisticated method than depth-first search to find
cycles, and should not be used for your answer. Your answer should
be simplified as much as possible; you may assume that $m > n$.)</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a system of voter preferences for which
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda count</a>
does not obey
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
property</a>. That is, for each of the $k!$ permutations of the set of
$k$ candidates, you should specify how many voters prefer that
permutation. This specification should have the property that there is
one candidate who wins all head-to-head competitions against individual
other candidates (the Condorcet winner), but that the Borda count
chooses a different winner than this candidate. As part of your answer,
specify who the Condorcet winner is and who the Borda winner
is.</p></li>
