Moishe,

I saw your note in the message board and wanted to reach out. I think I may have contacted your before
about the Langsams. My mother in law's first cousin was Marty Langsam who unfortunately passed last spring. 
He was the son of Jack/Hyman, grandson of Aaron. His children are my wife's second cousins.

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/aaron.htm

I have a very small part of the large Langsam tree if you ever are able to build it out on geni, and I am happy 
to merge to it.

I can also explain the Kopita connection - the Langsams, Pearlmans and Kopitas intersect in about three places 
in the same tree. Abraham Kopita was technically a step-uncle of Jack Langsam's wife Tessie Pearlman. Tessie's 
grandfather remarried a woman named Sarah Kopita - her son was Abraham. Abraham's wife Rose was also Aaron 
Langsam's younger sister so they all blend together. You really need a chart with lines and arrows to explain 
it all.

Thanks,
