married Chaya Tzivya Wildstein &amp; they lived in Wielopole Skrzynskie, Galicia. 
Later on, they moved to Wadowice, where Usher Zelig was a <I>shochet</I>.

Almost the entire family perished in the Holocaust.

	(1870 - 1924 [5 Adar II]) married Faigel Rappaport, daughter of R. Boruch (who was married to a Reigler), and had 5 children. Moshe was first <I>shochet</I> in Amsana (Mszana Dolna), and later <I>dayan</I> &amp; <I>chazan</I> in Wadowice, Galicia. In his later years his vision became impaired but he was still able to daven flawlessly, by heart. In fact, his memory was so good that he could open just the bottom portion of any page in <I>Shulchan Aruch</I> (Code of Jewish Law) and by reading the last few lines of the commentary (<I>Pri Migadim</I>), be able to recite the entire page. He	also maintained a yeshiva out of his home. Faigel perished in the Holocaust, on 20 Tamuz, 1943. Almost the entire remainder of the family also perished.
