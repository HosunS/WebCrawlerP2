<h1>
Improved Bounds on the Growth Constant of Polyiamonds
</h1>
<h2>
Gill Barequet, Technion 
</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
A polyiamond is an edge-connected set of cells on the planar triangular
lattice.  The area of a polyiamond is the number of cells it contains.
The growth constant of polyiamonds, $\lambda_T$, is the limit of the
ratio between the number of polyiamonds of area n+1 and the number of
polyiamonds of area n, as n tends to infinity.  In this talk I will show
improved lower and upper bounds on $\lambda_T$, proving that it is
between 2.8424 and 3.6050.

<p>
Joint work with Mira Shalah and Yufei Zheng (both from Technion, Israel).
