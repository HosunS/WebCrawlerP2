//
// ICS 21 / CSE 21 Summer 2012
// Lab 0
//
// This class implements the "engine" for the "guess a number" game.
// The engine is in charge of choosing a random number, comparing the
// user's guesses to the target number, and responding accordingly.
//
// Notice that this class does not perform input/output.  This is by
// design.  I've separated the user interface and the "engine" into
// two classes, for a very good reason: it allows the user interface
// to be changed without affecting the engine at all.  This may seem
// silly in a program as small as this one, but I'd like you to see
// the idea, as early as possible, that the name of the game is
// writing relatively simple components that do single, targeted
// jobs and know as little as possible about one another.  As it
// stands now, GuessNumberGame doesn't rely on the fact that this
// program's user interface uses the console.  That means that we
// could replace the user interface with a graphical one without
// making any modifications to GuessNumberGame.
