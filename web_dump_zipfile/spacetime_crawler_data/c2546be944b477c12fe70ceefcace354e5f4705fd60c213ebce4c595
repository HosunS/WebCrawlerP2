<p>These are general instructions for preparing to join and participate in
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">XHTML2 Working Group</a>. They are meant to inform both <a href="#member">those who work for a W3C Member</a> organization and <a href="#nonmember">those who do not</a>.</p>

 <p>If you have any further questions about joining this group, please send email to the Team Contact(s): .</p>

<h3 id="member">If you work for or represent a W3C Member organization</h3>

<h4>If you are the Advisory Committee Representative of the W3C Member</h4>

<p>You are the person responsible for formally joining
this group on behalf of your organization and then nominating
individuals to the group. You may also receive requests from others in your organization suggesting that you join the group; there is a tool to manage the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/queue">queue of requests to join groups</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the <a href="/groups/w3cgroups/32107/charter">XHTML2 Working Group Charter</a>.</li>
  <li>If you do not already have a W3C Access Account login and
  password (<a href="http://www.w3.org/accounts/recover">check if
  there is an account associated with your email address</a>),
    complete the <a href="https://www.w3.org/accounts/request">Account Request Form</a>. </li>
  <li>After you got your W3C Member account validated:
    <ol>
      <li>complete the <a href="join">form for joining the XHTML2 Working Group</a> on behalf of your organization;</li>
      <li>complete the <a href="change">form for nominating
  individuals to participate in the XHTML2 Working Group</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> When you
  rejoin a group after a rechartering, you do not need to
  renominate representatives; they are automatically
  renominated when you join. You may change representatives if you wish.

organization</h4>

<li>Your Advisory Committee Representative will determine whether to join the group and have the opportunity to nominate you to represent your organization in the group.</li>
