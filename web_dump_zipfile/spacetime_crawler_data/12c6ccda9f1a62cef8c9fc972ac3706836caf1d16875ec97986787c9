<h1>Python Download and Installation Instructions</h1>
<p>
</center>
<hr align="left" width="100%">
<p>

You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Python.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
<p>
This document shows downloading and installing Python 3.7.0 on Windows 7 in
  Summer 2018.
<b>You should download and install the latest version of Python.</b>
The current latest (as of Winter 2019) is Python 3.7.2.
<p>
Remember that you must install Java, Python, and Eclipse as all 32-bit or
  all 64-bit.
I recommend using the 32-bit verisons for each.
<p>

<hr align="left" width="100%">

<h2>Python: Version 3.7.0</h2>
<p>

The Python download requires about 25 Mb of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to re-install Python.
When installed, Python requires about an additional 90 Mb of disk space.
<p>
<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Click
    <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target = "_blank">
      Python Download</a>.
    <p>
    The following page will appear in your browser.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythondownloadpage.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Click the <b>Download Python 3.7.0</b> button.
    <p>
    The file named <b>python-3.7.0.exe</b> should start downloading into your
      standard download folder.
    This file is about 30 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 10 seconds over a
      cable modem).
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/exefile.jpg">

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python
      (and reinstall it easily later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Feel free to explore this webpage further; if you want to just continue
  the installation, you can terminate the tab browsing this webpage.

<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>
<p>

<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the icon labeling the file <b>python-3.7.0.exe</b>.
    <p>
    An <b>Open File - Security Warning</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/openfilesecuritywarning.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Run</b>.
    <p>
    A <b>Python 3.7.0 (32-bit) Setup</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup.jpg">
    <p>
    Ensure that the <b>Install launcher for all users (recommended)</b> and the
       <b>Add Python 3.7 to PATH</b> checkboxes at the bottom are checked.
    <p>
    If the Python Installer finds an earlier version of Python installed on
      your computer, the <b>Install Now</b> message may instead appear as
      <b>Upgrade Now</b> (and the checkboxes will not appear).

<p>
<li>Highlight the <b>Install Now</b> (or <b>Upgrade Now</b>) message, and then
    click it.
    <p>

    A <b>User Account Conrol</b> pop-up window will appear, posing the question
      <b>Do you want the allow the following program to make changes to this
      computer?</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/useraccountcontrol.jpg">
<p>

<li>Click the <b>Yes</b> button.
    <p>
    A new <b>Python 3.7.0 (32-bit) Setup</b> pop-up window will appear with
      a <b>Setup Progress</b> message and a progress bar.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetup2new.jpg">
    <p>
    During installation, it will show the various components it is installing
      and move the progress bar towards completion.
    Soon, a new <b>Python 3.7.0 (32-bit) Setup</b> pop-up window will appear
      with a <b>Setup was successfuly</b> message.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonsetupsuccessful.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Close</b> button.
</ol>
<p>
Python should now be installed.

<h3>Verifying</h3>
To try to verify installation,
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the directory
    <b>C:\Users\Pattis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32</b>
   (or to whatever directory Python was installed: see the pop-up window
   for Installing step 3).
<p>

<li>Double-click the icon/file <b>python.exe</b>.
<p>
The following pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/python/pythonrunning.jpg">
    <p>
A pop-up window with the title
  <b>C:\Users\Pattis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32</b>
  appears, and inside the window; on the first line is the text
   <b>Python 3.7.0 ...</b> (notice that it should also say 32 bit).
Inside the window, at the bottom left, is the prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>: type
  <b>exit()</b> to this prompt and press <b>enter</b> to terminate Python.
<p>
You should keep the file <b>python-3.7.0.exe</b> somewhere on your computer in
   case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).
<p>
You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java (you should
  have already installed Java, but if you haven't, it is OK to do so now, so
  long as you install both Python and Java before you install Eclipse), and
  then follows the instruction to download and install the Eclipse IDE.
Note: you you need to download/install Java even if you are using Eclipse only
  for Python)
