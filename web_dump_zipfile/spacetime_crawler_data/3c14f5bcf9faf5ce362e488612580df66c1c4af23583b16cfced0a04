Here is some additional information related to using floppies (that will be incl
uded in future lab notes).

<LI>If you are working on different hosts collecting data, you can save locally
and then ftp the data to the machine that has the floppy installed in it. this c
an also be used to get around the floppy drive problem, if one machine has a bro
ken floppy drive, then just use another machine's floppy drive and ftp the files
 over when you are done.
<br>
<LI> besides using mtools you can also mount the floppy drive:
<br>
Mounting a Floppy:
<br>
In order to use floppy disks, insert an MS-DOS formatted floppy disk into the fl
oppy disk drive. Then mount the floppy using the commands:
<br>
mount  /mnt/floppy
<br>
This command will mount a floppy disk under the directory: /mnt. Then use /mnt/f
loppy to refer to your floppy, e.g.:
<br>
ls /mnt/floppy
<br>
To manipulate the files in the floppy disk, use the same Unix commands as usual
(e.g. to copy a file into the floppy disk,
<br>
cp file_name    /mnt/floppy
<br>
When you are done, you need to un mount the floppy using the following command:
<br>
umount  /mnt/floppy
<br>
This will un mount the floppy. If you eject before un mounting you will crash the machine!

I have made some changes to the Lab Notes and posted the new corrected version. If you follow the link you will get the updated notes. Note one important change:
http://www.tcpip-lab.net/links/man.cgi was changed to:
http://www.tcpip-lab.net/links/manual.html  <br>
Also, Part 1 exercise 2, the cross over cables are not working with all the 
PC interface cards. So please skip the cross over cable exercise and just 
connect all hosts using the hub  only.

These will be replaced soon. Please report any other h/w problems to myself and

<H3>Announcement 6: 10/2/01 </H3>

There were some errors with URLs in prelab and I clarified some exercises based
on feedback I got from some of your colleagues. Had mostly to do with resetting
the interfaces at the end of the exercises when IP addresses/netmasks were chang
ed during the exercise. Also, in exercise 9, for the lab report, the login and p
asswd are in different packets not in the same packet. The sentence in the lab r
eport is not clear on that.

<H3>Announcement 7: 10/3/01 </H3>

I placed a handout version of the lecture notes on the website. Please go to the bottom of the outline page to find the URL for the handouts. 6 slides per page.

<H3>Announcement 8: 10/8/01 </H3>

<LI> You only need to do part 1 of lab3 this week. The lab report is required bu
t the prelab is optional this week. You will have to hand the prelab in the foll
owing week if you do not get it in this week. In otherwords, we need to get a Pr
e Lab for lab 3 from you, attach it to either this week's lab report (part 1) or
 next week's lab report (parts 2-5).
<LI> Please include only the necessary output, do not print (ie save) "Details"
for your Ethereal output if not needed. Only include parts of the output in your
 report that are relevant to the questions that are being asked, and if it is sa
ys include output make sure you have captured only what is needed and not more.

<LI> For lab 2 we will ignore this since I did not specify it more clearly, but
for the remaining labs I will ask the graders to penalize excessive output.
<LI> From now on, new announcements will be placed at the top of this page.
