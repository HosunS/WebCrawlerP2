of chess. Six different encodings written in pure prolog are included.

The six encoding are briefly described below:

1) chess_flann_new: Written by flann@cs.orst.edu. Employs a geometric 
   representation for states, with each square designated by an X,Y 
   coordinate and square connectivity computed by vectors. Generates 
   legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those 
   that result in the moving player being in check.

2) chess_flann_wyl: Written by flann@cs.orst.edu. Employs a relational
   representation for states, with each square given a unique name and 
   square connectivity computed by an enumeration of connected relations.
   Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating
   those that result in the moving player being in check.

3) chess_russell_wyl: Originally written by Stuart Russell in MRS, 
   translated into prolog by flann@cs.orst.edu. Employs a geometric 
   representation for states, with each square designated by an X,Y 
   coordinate and square connectivity computed by vectors. Generates 
   legal moves by determining whether the moving side is in check.
   If the moving side is in check, moves are generated that destroy the
   check threat. If the moving side is not in check, moves are generated 
   that do not create a check threat. Note that if the moving side 
   is in check from multiple threats then the domain theory generates 
   incorrect moves.

4) chess_vijay_1: Written by vijay@cs.orst.edu. Employs a relational
   representation for states, with each square given a unique name and 
   square connectivity computed by an enumeration of connected relations.
   Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating
   those that result in the moving player being in check.

5) chess_vijay_2: Written by vijay@cs.orst.edu. Employs a geometric 
   representation for states, with each square designated by an X,Y 
   coordinate and square connectivity computed by vectors. Generates 
   legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those 
   that result in the moving player being in check.

6) chess_vijay_3: Written by vijay@cs.orst.edu. Employs a special linear
   representation for states, with each square designated by a single number
   and square connectivity computed by a single delta value. Generates 
   legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those 
   that result in the moving player being in check.

Each domain theory includes a sample state called state1 that describes
the board position illustrated as Figure 4(d) in Flann and Dietterich,
"A study of explanation-based methods for inductive learning" in 
Machine Learning, 4 187-226. See file test_domain_theories for an example
of loading and running the domain theories.

In addition to the domain theories, a file called support_code is 
included that contains some useful prolog routines. One routine
takes a generic chess board description and a domain theory name, and
produces a prolog state description suitable for use with the given 
domain theory. See file test_domain_theories for an example of 
generating state descriptions.
