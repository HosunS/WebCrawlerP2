<H2>A note on ancient labyrinths</H2>

Anthony Phillips writes in "The Topology of Roman Mosaic Mazes",
<I>Leonardo</I>, vol. 25, no. 3/4, pp. 321-329, 1992:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Floor mosaics were a common form of interior decoration in Roman times,
and a maze pattern was a perennial theme... these mazes are unicursal
(without bifurcation)...
<P>
We have no record of the work that went into developing this concept,
but there is a related class of figures going much farther back in
history: various forms of the famous Cretan maze.  The earliest
illustrations of this maze that can be securely dated are a pair of
figures on a clay pot from Tell Rifa'at, Syria (dated before 1200BC) and
a doodle scratched on the back of a clay accounting tablet in King
Nestor's palace in Pylos (Western Greece) and hardened by fire when the
palace burned down around 1200BC). ... The game of drawing this nucleus
and completing it to a maze is still played today. ...
<P>
Once the mazes are unrolled, it bicomes obvious that they are intimately
related to, and perhaps derived from, the meander patterns ubiquitous in
primitive decoration.  It should be noted that meanders and mazes appear
interchangeably on the earliest coins from Knossos ... suggesting
strongly that [these forms] were equivalent symbols for the Labyrinth.
<P>
... every Roman mosaic maze that has survived
intact is a meander maze, and I will make the case that the mazes that
do not appear to be of this type fail to do so because of faulty
restoration or recording.
