  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Background</h2>
  <p>
    The Cyber-T Bayesian statistical framework was developed by 
    <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pfbaldi">Pierre Baldi</a> and first implemented in collaboration with 
    <a href="http://wfitch.bio.uci.edu/~tdlong/">Tony Long</a>  <a href="/help/#references">[1]</a>. 
    The web interface was first implemented by Harry Mangalam. Cyber-T has received valuable inputs
    from many UCI biologists, in particular from  G. Wesley Hatfield,
    Denis Heck, She-pin Hung, Michelle Riehle and Suzanne Sandmeyer. The program has been maintained 
    and extended by various members of the Baldi group, including: Yann Pecout, Laurence Richard, Suman Sundaresh, 
    Michael Zeller, and Matthew Kayala.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Cyber-T has been ranked by investigators from Harvard University and the Pasteur Institute as the best commercial or
    public software package for the analysis and interpretation of DNA microarray data 
    [<a href="/help/#references">2</a>].  
    The superiority of Cyber-T was further demonstrated in other comparison experiments 
    [<a href="/help/#references">3-5</a>].
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to DNA microarray analysis [<a href="/help/#references">6-8</a>], Cyber-T has been used to analyze 
    other high-throughput data, including protein microarrays [<a href="/help/#references">9,10</a>] and 
    quantitative mass spectrometry data (for example [<a href="/help/#references">11</a>]).
    Current works in press use Cyber-T for the differential analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, etc).

<div class="form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Downloading/Installing Cyber-T R Code</h2>
  <h4>***NEW: Newly written Cyber-T library (bayesreg.R) available for download.***</h4>
  <h4><a href="/download/">Download here!</a></h4>
  <p>
    The new version includes paired and unpaired t-tests, one-way ANOVA, 
    and all recent improvements such as extreme low 
    replication handling, normalization, and post-processing options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cyber-T and/or the R library (including the old hdarray and new bayesreg.R) is free for academic, non-commercial, 
    research use only. The appropriate references <a href="/help/#references">[1]</a> should be cited when used for 
    academic/research purposes. For commercial licenses, 
    please contact <a href="mailto:igb-license@ics.uci.edu?Subject=CyberT">IGB Licences</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To work with the Cyber-T library written in R directly, you need to have R installed. 
    There are installation packages available for most platforms and source code that will compile with gcc, all available via your 
    nearest node of the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming you have R installed on your system, just 'source' the bayesreg.R file using either the command
    line interface or the menu.
  </p>
  <h4>What is in the Cyber-T library (bayesreg.R)?</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li>
      <b>bayesT</b>            : main function for unpaired two-sample t-tests (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian versions)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>bayesT.pair</b>       : main function for paired two-sample t-tests (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian versions).
      A paired test is appropriate when controls and experimentals are paired. 
      An example of this is "Brown-type" array data where each control has a matching experimental treatment. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>runAllBayesAnova</b>      : main function for the one-way ANOVA (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian versions).
      An ANOVA is appropriate when there are more than two experimental conditions to analyze. 
      An example of this would be array data from more than two different types of tissue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>ppdeMix</b> : main function for running Posterior Probability of Differential Expression analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>runVsn</b> : main function to run Variance Stabilizing Normalization (VSN) pre-processing.  
      Note:  The 'vsn' package from <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> must be installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>runMulttest</b> : main function to calculate Bonferroni and Benjamini &amp; Hochberg multiple
      hypothesis testing correction.  
      Note:  The 'multtest' package from <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> must be installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>postHoc</b>             : main function to run postHoc tests for the one-way ANOVA.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>cyberTPlots</b> : main function for plotting the basics of the data. The 'lattice' package must be installed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The bayesreg.R file is well commented.  It should be easy to use with a minimal knowledge of R.
  </p>
</div>

    <a id="runR"></a>
    

<div class="form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Using the bayesreg.R code in R</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on what platform you are running the R code, you need to use the menu options and 'source' the bayesreg.R file.
      This loads all the functions in hdarray in to R. On Windows or Unix-like systems, you can type "source(filename)" at
      the command line. You may also want to use the menu option to change the R working directory to the directory that
      contains your data. Let's assume a simple text file 'Expt1.txt' as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
      C1,C2,E1,E2
      gene1,10,8,7,9
      gene2,6,5,7,6
      gene3,4,5,8,9</pre>
    <p>
      The following commands demonstrate how to read a data file and invoke the 
      various functions to perform t-tests or 
      bayes-t-tests on either paired, unpaired, multiple conditions data. The R command 
      line prompt may look like this "&gt;" after which you can type the commands shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the data file which, in this case, is comma separated. If the file is tab separated, ignore the 'sep' field. Do 
      not type the 
      "&gt;". If the data file is not in your working directory, you need to specify the full file path. <br />
      Tab delimited file:<br />
      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table("Expt1.txt")</i><br />
      Comma delimited file:<br />
      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table("Expt1.txt",sep=",")</i><br />
      Space delimited file:<br />
      <i>&gt; dataFile&lt;-read.table("Expt1.txt",sep=" ")</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the first row to make sure the file has been read correctly<br />
      <i> &gt; dataFile[1,]</i>
    </p>
    <pre>
      C1 C2 E1 E2
      gene1 10  8  7  9  </pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, the file has been read correctly. Since the first line had column names, the file was read correctly 
      as the
      header. Note that there is no header name for the gene name column hence the gene name column is used to label the 
      rows. 
      If you don't have the column names, it works just fine too. R will create its own column names.       
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the dimensions of the dataset. The first number is the number of rows, the second is the number of columns.
      <br />
      <i>&gt; dim(dataFile)</i>
    </p>
    <pre>
      [1] 3 4 </pre>
    <p>
      Now that the data has been read, we can proceed to apply the various functions.  
      Let's apply the standard unpaired t-test (with bayesT and appropriate parameters).
      <br />
      <i>&gt; bayesT(dataFile,numC=2,numE=2,ppde=0,bayes=0)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The outputs of the code are exactly the outputs from the webserver.  All parameters in the functions
      correspond with form elements on the webserver (and are documented in the code comments).
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it! When you apply the commands above, the data file gets processed and some output files - 
      <i>allgene.txt, ROC.txt, mix.txt and several png files </i>- are saved
      in your working directory. 'allgene.txt' contains all the analysis output data. 'png' files contain supporting graphs, 
      'mix.txt' contains the mixture model parameters, and 'ROC.txt' contains the x and y-coordinates for the ROC plot in temp.ps. 
      Note: some of these files may not get generated depending on the parameters used.
      See <a href="/help/#results">the Cyber-T results section</a> for details.
    </p>
</div>

    <hr noshade size=3 />
    <a id="fileformat"></a>
    

<div id="file-format-wrapper" class="form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">File Format</h2>
  <p>
    The format expected is 
    essentially the output of a spreadsheet file in ASCII or plain text with the
    values delimited by tabs, commas, or spaces. If your data are in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program,
    they should be saved as text files and delimited by tabs, commas, or spaces. 
    Make sure that your labels (gene names) do not include whatever you choose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Comments can be inserted anywhere in the text as long as the comment lines are prefixed by a '#' because
    the underlying R code will ignore command lines beginning with #. Column headings must be removed unless
    they are preficed by a # sign or specifically excluded by identifying which is data start row. 
    Do note that having the # sign in the middle of a line without prefixing the line with a # will 
    result in errors. For example, please ensure that none of the gene names (in the label column) have a
    # in them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Missing values are coded as 'NA' (not 'na' - case matters) and values below background are coded as zero
    (&quot;0&quot;) 
  </p> 
  <p>
    There must be at least one label column.  And columns for the same condition must be contiguous.  
    Examples are given below for each analysis type.
  </p>
  <h4>Unpaired two-conditions data</h4>
  <p>
    For this type of analysis, where the first condition is a control, and second condition is an experimental, 
    columns should be in this order:
    <!--  For example, for an <strong>unpaired two-conditions</strong> analysis that involved a 
          control and experimental conditions, the columns should be in this order:-->
  </p>
    <pre>
    Label, ControlReplicate1, ControlReplicate2, ExperimentalReplicate1, ExperimentalReplicate2</pre>
  <p>
    Of course, you can have more than two control or experimental replicates, but they must be contiguous.
    You cannot have (for example) control columns, then experimental columns, the control columns again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's an example file:
  </p> 
  <pre>
    # here's a comment
    # and another, and the line below is also a comment which is OK to insert
    # Label ContColumn1 ContColumn2 ExpColumn1 ExpColumn2
    # the real data starts just after this line 
    GH01040 0.81888287 0.98072154 1.16866872 1.38928931
    GH01059 0.87158715 0.9766095 1.05333957 1.18938903
    # comments can be interspersed as long as the line begins with a '#'
    GH01066 0.8881064 0.45129639 0.79107254 0.90903492
    GH01085 0.53412245 0.84194019 0.95338764 1.22393455</pre>
  <h4>Paired two-conditions data</h4>
  <p>
    For paired data, you must upload raw measurements of two conditions with an equal number
    of replicates.
    Please see the <a href="/help/#pairs">Pairs Help Section</a> for more details of 
    when and why a Paired analysis is appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
    With raw measurements, columns should be in the following order:
  </p>
  <pre>
    Label, Cond1Repl1, Cond1Repl2, Cond2Repl1, Cond2Repl2</pre>
  <p>
    This means that Cond1Repl1 will be <strong>paired</strong> with Cond2Repl1, 
    and similarly Cond1Repl2 will be <strong>paired</strong> with Cond2Repl2.  
    Of course, you can have more than two columns per condition, but the number of columns in each condition 
    <strong>must</strong> be equal.  The Unpaired two conditions data example file from above works as an 
    example for this type of data.
  </p>
  <h4>Multiple conditions data</h4>
  <p>For this type of data, the columns for each condition should be contiguous.
    For example with three conditions having two replicates each, columns should be in the following order: </p>
  <pre>
    Label, Cond1Repl1, Cond1Repl2, Cond2Repl1, Cond2Repl2, Cond3Repl1, Cond3Repl2</pre>
  <p>
    Again, you could have more than three conditions or more than two replicates each, but columns from the same 
    condition need to be next to one another.  Here is an example file:
  </p>
  <pre>
    # here's a comment
    # and another, and the line below is also a comment which is OK to insert
    # Label Cond1Column1 Cond1Column2 Cond2Column1 Cond2Column2 Cond3Column1 Cond3Column2
    # the real data starts just after this line 
    GH01040 0.81888287 0.98072154 1.16866872 1.38928931 1.78923471 1.65654518

<div class="form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Paired Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    The Paired (with ratios or differences) approach <b><i>pairs</i></b> a control value with 
    an experimental value i.e. C1 with E1, C2 with E2, etc. The
    Unpaired (or ANOVA) approach does no such pairing.  The difference is that if samples
    really are paired, the variance in the denominator can be much smaller
    (and hence power greater).  The paired t-test evaluates whether the mean
    difference between paired samples is significantly different from
    zero, whereas the non-paired t-test tests if the mean of group 1 is
    different from the mean of group 2.  Let's do a &quot;classic&quot; example.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is the body weight of a group of people before and after some diet regime was applied:
  </p>
  <pre>
    PERSON      BEFORE          AFTER      DIFFERENCE

    Joe           200            180          -20
    Sue           120            100          -20
    George        175            155          -20</pre>
  <p>
    (Note: People here are like replicate experiments and Before and After are like Control versus Experimental).  
    Doing a 
    &quot;paired t-test&quot; results in showing the diet is very effective -- everyone loses 20 lb with no 
    variance (that is: the 
    mean difference is significantly different from zero). On the other hand, if we take the 
    (Mean of the Afters) - (Mean of the Befores), the difference is still 20, however the variance 
    <i>within treatments</i> 
    is large so it is impossible 
    to say the difference is significant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically when observations are &quot;paired&quot; the paired approach is the correct and 
    most powerful approach, when 
    observations are not paired then we have to use the unpaired approach.

  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Reasons for unsuccessful file upload</h2>
  <p>
    If you can see the file in your browser window, you should be able to upload it. However, some operating
    systems will refuse to let an already open file be manipulated by another application. If this is the
    case, you should get an error message when you try to upload it, perhaps even interpretable message.
    Generally, you would have to close the window of the file in the other application.  Erroneous processing
    of the file could be due to a number of things.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you tried to upload a binary file (such as a native-format Excel file, it would be misread by 
      the parsing script and produce gibberish).
    </li>        
    <li>
      If you confused the stated field delimiters with the actual delimiters. For example, if you saved 
      your data delimited by COMMAS and indicated that it was TAB delimited (or more usually, didn't change the 
      default delimiter from WHITESPACE.
      If this happens, R will complain about mismatched vector lengths.
      This has often proved to be the case with users of Macs and PCs where many applications allow the 
      embedding of spaces in the label field. It's always a good idea to replace spaces with underscores (_) in 
      these cases.

    The statistical analyses performed by Cyber-T assumes that the data are approximately normal.  
    This is often not the case with raw microarray (or other high-throughput) data.
    A common technique is to take the natural log (<i>ln</i>) of the data before processing.
    However, this approach has several drawbacks, mainly dealing with the inability to handle negative values.
    An alternative approach called VSN is based on the <i>asinh</i> transform 
    and an assumption of a majority of genes being non-differentially expressed [<a href="/help/#references">12</a>].
    The webserver allows for pre-processing with optional low value thresholding or offsetting, and optional Log or 
    VSN normalizations.  If a Log or VSN normalization is chosen, some plots displaying the effect of the normalization
    are generated.

  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Posterior Probability of Differential Expression (Optional)</h2>
  <p>
    To interpret the results of a high-throughput data experiments, it
    is necessary to determine the global false positive and negative
    levels inherent in the data set being analyzed. We have implemented
    a mixture-model based method described by Allison <i>et
    al.</i> <a href="/help/#references">[13]</a> for the
    computation of the global false positive and negative levels
    inherent in a DNA microarray experiment <a href="/help/#references">[6,8]</a>.  
    The basic idea is to consider
    the <i>p-</i>values as a new data set and to build a probabilistic
    model for these new data. When control data sets are compared to one
    another (i.e. no differential gene expression) it is easy to see
    that the <i>p-</i>values ought to have a uniform distribution
    between zero and one. In contrast, when data sets from different
    genotypes or treatment conditions are compared to one another, a
    non-uniform distribution will be observed in which <i>p-</i>values
    will tend to cluster more closely to zero than one.

    <b>Distribution of the <i>p-</i>values from the <i>lrp+</i> vs.

  </p>
  <p>
    The <i>p-</i>values, based on a regularized t-test distribution, of
    the 2,758 genes (<i>lrp+</i> vs. <i>lrp-</i>) expressed at value
    above background in all replicate experiments grouped into 100 bins
    and plotted against the number of genes in each bin. The dotted line
    indicates the uniform distribution of <i>p-</i>values under
    conditions of no differential expression. The fitted model (dashed
    curve) is a mixture of a beta and the uniform distribution (dotted
    line).
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, there will be a subset of differentially expressed genes
    with &quot;significant&quot; <i>p-</i>values.  The computational
    method of Allison <a href="/help/#references">[13]</a>
    is used to model this mixture of uniform and non-uniform
    distributions to determine the probability, PPDE(p) ranging from 0
    to 1, that any gene at any given <i>p-</i>value is differentially
    expressed; that is, that it is a member of the uniform (not
    differentially expressed) or the non-uniform (differentially
    expressed) distribution. With this method, we can estimate the rates
    of false positives and false negatives as well as true positives and
    true negatives at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold,
    PPDE(&lt;p). In other words, we can obtain a posterior probability
    of differential expression PPDE(p) value for each gene measurement
    and a PPDE(&lt;p) value at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold based
    on the experiment-wide global false positive level and
    the <i>p-</i>value exhibited by that gene
    <a href="/help/#references">[6,8]</a>. It should also
    be emphasized that this information allows us to infer the
    genome-wide number of genes that are differentially expressed; that
    is, the fraction of genes in the non-uniform distribution
    (differentially expressed) and the fraction of genes in the uniform
    distribution (not differentially expressed).

  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Parameters for the Bayesian Standard Deviation Estimation (Optional)</h2>
  <p>
    In calculating the Bayesian estimate of the standard deviation there are two different parameters that the user must 
    set. These 2 parameters relate to setting the Bayesian estimate of variance derived from the observed population. 
    The t-test is used to detect significant differences between the means of two groups relative to the observed variance 
    within groups. In a perfect world, all micro-array experiments would be highly replicated within each experimental 
    treatment. Such replication would allow accurate estimates of the variance within experimental treatments to be 
    obtained and the t-test would then perform well. Microarray experiments are expensive and time consuming to carry out, 
    and there is the possibility that both control and experimental tissues will be limiting. As a result, the level of 
    replication within experimental treatments is often low. This results in poor estimates of within-treatment variance 
    and a corresponding poor performance of the t-test itself. This problem can be solved addressed using a Bayesian 
    statistical approach that incorporates prior information in the estimation of within gene within treatment variances. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Although in terms of strong inference there is really no substitute for proper experimental replication, in the case of 
    microarrays many parallel pseudo-replicated experiments are carried out on any given microarray (i.e., one experiment 
    for each gene). In particular, it is possible to use estimates of within-treatment variance from a number of genes of 
    similar expression level to stabilize estimates of variance for any given gene. More precisely, the variance within any 
    given treatment is estimated by the weighted average of a prior estimate of the variance for that gene (obtained from 
    of local weighted average of the variance of other genes) and the experimental estimate of the variance for that gene. 
    This weighting factor is controlled by the experimenter and will depend on how confident the experimenter is that the 
    background variance of a closely related set of genes approximates the variance of the gene under consideration. 
  </p>
  <p>
    An important property of this Bayesian approach to consider is that in the two limiting cases of complete confidence in 
    the prior and zero confidence in the prior, the Bayesian approach is equivalent to simply looking at fold change and 
    testing differences between treatments using the simple t-test respectively. In the Bayesian approach the weight given 
    to the within gene variance estimate is a function of the number of observations contributing to that value. This leads 
    to the desirable property of the Bayesian approach converging to the t-test as the experimenter carries out additional 
    replications and thus becomes more confident of the observed estimate of within treatment variance for any given gene. 
  </p>
  <h4>1. Sliding Window Size</h4>
  <p>
    Indicates how wide you want the window surrrounding the point under consideration to be. This sample of the data 
    provides an estimate of the average variability of gene expression for those genes that show a similar expression 
    level.  It is important to estimate this average from a wide enough level that it is accurate, but not so wide of a 
    window so as to average in genes with too different of average expression level. A sliding window of 101 genes has been 
    shown to be quite accurate when analyzing 2000 or more genes, with only 1000 genes a window of 51 genes may work 
    better.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Bayes Confidence Estimate Value</h4>
  <p>
    This is a number from 0 to infinity that indicates the weight give to the Bayesian prior estimate of within-treatment 
    variance. Larger weights indicate greater confidence in the Bayesian prior; smaller weights 
    indicate more confidence in the experimentally observed variance.  We have observed reasonable performance with the 
    following rule of thumb:  set the confidence such that the number of experimental observations plus the confidence is greater 
    than 8.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the confidence is left blank or zero, then a simple classical t-test is performed.  
    If there is only a single replicate in a given condition, then the standard deviation estimates are completely 
    determined by the prior, and a warning is issued to the user.  If the confidence is set to zero and there is only a 
    single replicate, we set a default confidence of 5 and issue a warning to the user.

<div class="form-section-wrapper ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">One-way ANOVA and Post-hoc Tests</h2>
  <p>
    T-tests are appropriate for two-condition comparisons.  However, with more than two conditions,
    for example, given three types of tissues, a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is the proper 
    way to handle the analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an ANOVA, the null-hypothesis is that all conditions come from the same distribution.  
    Therefore, if for a given gene, we decide to reject the null-hypothesis (i.e., the p-value is below some 
    significance threshold), then we can conclude that the gene is different across conditions.  
    However, we cannot conclude anything about differences between any pair of conditions.  
    For example, say we have tissue samples from the liver, the heart, and the lung.  
    If for a given gene, the ANOVA p-value is less-than 0.5, we can conclude that the 
    gene is differentially expressed between the three tissues.  However, we cannot conclude that
    the gene is differentially expressed between the heart and the lung.  To make this determination, 
    we must use pairwise post-hoc tests.
    In essence, post-hoc tests examine differences across all pairs of conditions.
    Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (TukeyHSD) and Scheffe's Method are available 
    as post-hoc test options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: the pairwise post-hoc p-values are <strong>not</strong> corrected for multiple testing.  
    One should only examine pairwise post-hoc p-values for those measurements that are significant 
    (after multiple testing correction) at the ANOVA level.
    Following this step-wise procedure should provide sufficient protection against Type I errors due 
    to multiplicity.
    Low pairwise post-hoc p-values on their own are <strong>not</strong> indicitave of significant 
    differential behavior.

      Remove outliers: Produces plots where outliers (more than 2 IQR above or below the 1st or 2nd quantiles, 
      respectively) have been removed.  This allows the user to see the true relationship by plotting most of the data
      in a reasonable scale.

  <h2 class="ui-widget-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <h4>What is the difference between paired and non-paired analyses?</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Non-paired</b> experiments are those in which the control and experimental values are derived from separate arrays, 
    unlike the <b>paired</b> experiments in which the 2 values come from the same array, as in 2 dye (Cy3/Cy5) experiments, 
    aka  'Synteni' or 'Pat Brown-type' arrays. 
  </p>
  <h4>Where can I find more information about R?</h4>
  <p>
    R's (distributed) home, the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</a>
