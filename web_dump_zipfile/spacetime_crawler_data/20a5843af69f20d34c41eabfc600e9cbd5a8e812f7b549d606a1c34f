<P><B>Cyna HIRSCHBERG and his wife, Rosa ARONSFRAU</B>
<BR>
<BR>Cyna was the son of Mozes Israel Isser HIRSCHBERG & Elka Ryvka SCHENKER.
<BR>He was born in Krakow on November 18, 1879.
<BR>Rosa was the daughter of Hirsch ARONSFRAU & Braindla WEINBERG.
<BR>She was born in Krakow on April 25, 1882.
<BR>
<BR>They moved to Antwerp, probably around the turn of the century,
    and married there on January 29, 1907.
<BR>Their first two children, Annie and Emanuel were born in Antwerp.
<BR>Because of the war, they moved temporarily to Holland,
    where their third child, Leon, was born.
<BR>They returned to Belgium after the war.
<BR>With the onset of the second world war, they attempted
    to emigrate to the United States.
<BR>They were killed when their boat (S.S. Mount Kitheron) was sunk by the Germans
    off the coast of Newfoundland on Jan 25, 1942.
<BR>(It was a merchant ship waiting for the pilot
to bring the ship in; some of the crew took to life boats and survived.)
