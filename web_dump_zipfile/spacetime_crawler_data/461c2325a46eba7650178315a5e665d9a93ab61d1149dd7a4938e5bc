During this presentation I have explained Microsoftï¿½s vision of a future with wide spread distributed authoring and versioning. I have talked about the importance of backwards compatibility and why it should have its own sub-group. I have discussed why I feel new methods are often justified as a means to cleanly segregate functionality and why non-orthogonal headers are justified as a means to save bandwidth. I have discussed Microsoftï¿½s needs in the areas of distributed authoring and versioning and have given my own opinion on how we might solve those needs. Finally I discussed access control, why it is so vital, and why we should create a sub-group for it.
<BR></UL><UL>
I hope my presentation was informative and will help to spark healthy discussion and debate. We have a large job ahead of us but I am confident that we can provide a solution that will meet everyoneï¿½s needs and serve as a means to bring distributed authoring and versioning from the realm of program specific solutions out to the wide world.
