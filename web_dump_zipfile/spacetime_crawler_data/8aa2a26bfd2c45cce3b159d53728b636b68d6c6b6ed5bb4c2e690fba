Okay, here's my secret plan to take over the world.  Don't tell anybody.

When I die, I want a scalene triangle of unspecified scalenity on my tombstone.

The Master Masons carving my monument will say "Hey!  Kibo made this
easy for us 'cause he liked us!  So we like him!  Let's give him an
extra-special monument!" and then they'll carve it out of solid diamond
using a golden chisel, the most difficult expensive combination
other than Archimedes Plutonium's proposed solid plutonium pyramid tomb.

At sunrise on solstice morning, New Agers from around the world would
come to stare at the sun through my lens-shaped diamond tombstone.
Also, all the lettering on the tombstone would be not just incised
so you could feel it, but flavored so you could taste it.

All this from a humble scalene triangle, the cheapest kind to make,
unless you're using Legos.

And speaking of scalene triangles, it bothers me that you can have a
perfectly equilateral triangle but mathematicians have not yet agreed
on the dimensions of a perfectly scalene triangle.

I was going to propose one where the sides are 1, 2, and 3 units long,
as I think that would be a pretty cool triangle, what with side B being
twice side A and side C being three times A and 50% improved over B.
Also the angle opposite C would have over ten trijillion times as many
degrees (plus some radians, too) as any of the other two angles,
which would be so sharp you wouldn't be able to see them before you
accidentally tried to pick the triangle up.

But then I realized that what makes a 1:2:3 triangle so excitingly
scalene is that two sides are much longer than one of the other sides.
Wouldn't it be even better if side C was to B as B is to A?
Therefore, let's try 1:2:4.  Success!  The triangle is so scalene
that the mind of Man cannot even conceive of it!  And carrying this
scheme to its omega we reach the pinnacle of scalenitude:

           1  :  100000000  :  10000000000000000000000000000000000

The technical term for this triangle is "the equisilly triangle"
because no one angle in it is any sillier than the whole.

I have applied for a patent on the equisilly and am awaiting the
patent office's approval and the return of my working model.

Yay!  It's okay for me to waste other people's time as long as I'm happy!

You may be thinking of Richmond's construction (1893), as reproduced
in Stewart's "Galois Theory".  The proof begins with two perpindicular
radii OA and OB in a circle centered at O.  Then locate point I on OB
such that OI is 1/4 of OB.  Then locate the point E on OA such that
angle OIE is 1/4 the angle OIA.  Then find the point F on OA
(extended) such that EIF is half of a right angle.

Let K denote the point where the circle on AF cuts OB.  Now draw a
circle centered at E through the point K, and let N3 and N5 denote
the two points where this circle strikes OA.  Then, if perpindiculars
to OA are drawn at N3 and N5 they strike the main circle (the one
centered at O through A and B) at points P3 and P5.

The points A, P3, and P5 are the zeroth, third, and fifth verticies
of a regular heptadecagon, from which the remaining verticies are
easily found (i.e., bisect angle P3 O P5 to locate P4, etc.).

Gauss's Disquisitiones gives only the algebraic expression for the
cosine of 2pi/17 in terms of nested square roots, i.e.,

  cos(2pi/17)  =  -1/16 + 1/16 sqrt(17) + 1/16 sqrt[34 - 2sqrt(17)]

 + 1/8 sqrt[17 + 3sqrt(17) - sqrt(34-2sqrt(17)) - 2sqrt(34+2sqrt(17)]

which is just the solution of three nested quadratic equations.
Interestingly, although Gauss states in the strongest terms (all caps)
that his criteria for constructibility (based on Fermat primes) is
necessary as well as sufficient, he never published a proof of the
necessity, nor has any evidence of one ever been found in his papers
(according to Buhler's biography).

I've heard that this story is apochryphal (about Gauss, not about
Archimedes), but it's apparently true that Gauss's discovery of 
the 17-gon's constructibility (which had been an open problem from
antiquity) at or before the age of 19 led to his decision to follow 
a career in mathematics rather than philology.
