Hi,
Thanks so much for your feedback. Astonishingly, I do not seem to be able to place 
them within the current tree. Did your grandfather Manny have siblings? Do you know 
Manny's father's name? Do you know more specifically when they came?

Have you seen the website at 
www.langsam.com

Thanks!

Thanks for the update. What is your uncle's firs name? 

Would your uncle know who HIS grandfather was (Manny's father)? Did Manny have any 
siblings?

My uncle's name is Leonard Langsam. I believe he still lives in the Skokie area.
His number should be listed.

Hi,

Thanks for the contact. On www.switchboard.com I only find a David H Langsam in Glencoe, 
IL and a Martin A Langsam in Naperville, IL.

There is a Leo Langsam in Raleigh, NC and a L Langsam in Fairfax VA and in Columbia MD.

Any ideas or alternate contacts?

Thanks SO much!

Hello! so this is what I know about my grandmother.
Mania langsam mahler
Born in krosno poland I believe on may 3rd 1908 and her parents are Herschel 
and Elka langsam. I believe she had eight siblings? Her brother manny langsam 
located her after ww2   Living in Linz Austria in a DP camp with my grandfather 
fishel mahler, my father wolf and aunt elka and sent for them to come America 
on December 31st 1951. After they arrived in NYC in 1951 they moved to Chicago, 
Illinois to stay with manny langsam until they got on their feet. Manny langsam 
helped my grandfather fishel get his first job in america working as a kosher butcher.
Mania died of cancer on December 18, 1986 and she had four grandsons.

Hi,

You are part of the H93 branch of the tree. See
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/hrshelka.htm

I think your grandmother Mania is a younger sibling not listed on that webpage.

Also, we believe that H93, Hersh Langsam, was a brother to H24, Isaac Langsam. 
Can you confirm if your families knew of each other? 
See: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/isac-h24.htm

Randy, exactly how are you a grandchild to Mania?

Moishe Miller

Moishe, my father harry mahler is mania langsam Mahler's son as well as she had 
a daughter elka mahler. After speaking with my aunt ellen as she goes by now she 
never remember her mother talking about a brother named Isaac? I find it fascinating 
that their is no record of her existing in the family archives? I found myself having 
the same issue with my grandfather's records as well but I had just recently found 
out that my great grandfather on my grandfathers side had 13 children and refuse to 
pay the rabbi to have his children acknowledged by the local temple in their town of 
Krosno poland

Suzan Wynne, another Langsam Cousin, has done extensive research in Poland. See below 
what she had recorded about your specific family. Perhaps you should be looking for 
TRINCZER, the surname if his parents were not legally married.

Isaakï¿½s brother, Hersch, born in Zwierzen in Lesko district, married Elke Manaster 
and they had 5 known children in Europe: Josef 1890; Leib 1893; Szaje 1894; Mendel 
1894 or 1895; and Malka 1908. Elkeï¿½s brother, Harry Manaster, came to the US and headed 
for Chicago. Members of Elkeï¿½s family followed him there. Chaim Manaster wrote several 
emails outlining the family as he knew it.
Malka married (Efraim) Fischel Trinczer, born 1906 in Krosno to Bacia Trinczer. They might 
have been the parents of Tauba, who married Uscher Langsam. They lived in Paszowa in Lesko 
district. Uscher and Tauba, had Freida Malka in 1934. Presumably, they perished in the Shoah.
Can you add any detail to the H93 page? Know of any more siblings? Or any additional detail 
about the ones listed? I am in the process of updating that page to include your grandmother 
and the detail you are providing.

Subject: H24 and H93

Hi,

I was just contacted by someone from my H93.
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/hrshelka.htm

His grandmother was Mania, married to Fishel Mahler. 

In your new revision, page 82 of 112, you list my H93:
Isaakï¿½s brother, Hersch, born in Zwierzen in Lesko district, married Elke Manaster and they 
had 5 known children in Europe (you also mention Fishel, but use the surname of Trinczer, 
rather than Mahler).

You state that you believe that (H93) Hersh Langsam, was a brother to (H24) Isaac Langsam.
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/isac-h24.htm

How do you know this?

Well, according to Page 82, it seems that some of the information came via email from Chaim 
Manaster, though, based on what I wrote, it seems that some of the information in that section 
came from US records. There are more Lesko records available now. I haven't gone back to see 
if there is more information about the family. I have to assume that Chaim linked Isaak and 
Hersch as brothers. I may have saved some notes, though I discarded most notes when I developed 
the narrative. I simply don't have room in my small apartment for a lot of paper files.
 
As to why Trinczer and not Mahler, I don't know off the top of my head.

Moishe,
 
So, I just looked at Mahler and Trinczer in JRI and here's what I found:
 
In Krosno, Wolf Mahler and Basia Trinczer had an infant who died in 1901, Moses in 
1904 and Fischel in 1906. Wolf and Basia didn't have a civil marriage. This would 
explain why Fischel was associated with both names. 
 
A different Moses Trinczer and Fradel Fischbein had Basia in 1900. A cousin perhaps 
to the Basia above?  
 
Also in Krosno: Golde Trinczer and Fischel Fischbein had three children who died 
young between 1885-1887.
 
Suzan
