This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all
have had a part.  The scientists, burying their old professional
competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and
learned much.  It has been exhilarating to work in effective
partnership.  Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end.
What are the scientists to do next?

<p>

For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there
can be little indecision, for their war work has hardly required them
to leave the old paths.  Many indeed have been able to carry on their
war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories.  Their
objectives remain much the same.

<p>

It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride,
who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive
gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated
assignments.  They have done their part on the devices that made it
possible to turn back the enemy.  They have worked in combined effort
with the physicists of our allies.  They have felt within themselves
the stir of achievement.  They have been part of a great team.  Now,
as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy
of their best.
