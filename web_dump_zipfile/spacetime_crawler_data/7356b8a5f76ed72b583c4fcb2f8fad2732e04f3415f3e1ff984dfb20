* OVERVIEW *
************
JARtool was a pioneering effort to develop an automatic
system for cataloging small volcanoes in the large
set of Venus images returned by the Magellan spacecraft.
This package contains a variety of data to enable
researchers to evaluate algorithms over the same images
as used for the JARtool experiments reported in [1].

Modified:    07/09/99 by M.C. Burl - Added UCI's dataset form to the
  package, uci_form.txt.

Modified:    07/07/99 by M.C. Burl - Tried to clean things up a bit
  in preparation for donation to Padhraic's KDD archive. Added 
  performance ROC curves for the baseline JARtool system.

Modified:    09/25/98 by M.C. Burl - Changed the Experiments_Scoring_Table
  to include a column indicating the number of subexperiments for each
  major experiment in addition to the total area and total detection
  opportunities.

Modified:    09/24/98 by M.C. Burl - Added a Chips subdirectory that
  contains view format files holding the training and test chips and
  labels for each major/minor experiment.

Modified:    03/30/98 by M.C. Burl - Changed the groud truth files for 
  the images used in the HET5 experiment to be consistent with those
  used in MLJ98 paper. Note that the number of volcanoes published in
  Table 2 of MLJ98 paper *should not be used*. Instead, use the numbers
  in the Experiments_Scoring_Table.

* USAGE *
*********

One difficulty with comparing different learning/vision algorithms is
the absence of standard data sets on which tests are performed. It is
our intent that this data set become "a standard"; hence, we are
asking that anyone seeking to publish results on this data perform the
*FULL SUITE* of experiments defined in the Experiments_Images_Table
and compare performance to that of the baseline JARtool
system. Results on a small subset of images (e.g., HOM4) are not of
interest and *SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED*. Send e-mail to
jartool@aig.jpl.nasa.gov if you believe you have a compelling reason
to deviate from this policy.

There are two communities of researchers who we believe will be
interested in the data: (1) computer vision/image processing and (2)
machine learning/data mining. Hence, we have set things up to
accomodate both groups.  Computer vision people will probably be
interested in developing or testing algorithms that start from the raw
images and end up with a hypothesized list of volcano
locations. Machine learning people, on the other hand, will probably
be more interested in starting from a set of candidate regions and
deciding whether a candidate region is a volcano or not.  In the
JARtool system, the process of going from images to candidate regions
is called "focus of attention" or FOA. For each experiment, lists of
candidate volcano locations generated by the JARtool FOA algorithm are
provided.  Machine learning types can use these lists to extract
regions or chips around each of candidate location and then continue
with their analysis (deriving features from pixels, applying neural
nets, etc.). Note, however, that a small percentage of true volcanoes
(10-15%) are missed by the FOA limiting the maximum achievable
performance. For convenience, a set of pre-extracted chips that are
separated into training and testing has recently been added to the
dataset.

We would appreciate that you report your results on the *FULL SUITE*
of experiments (whether POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) and a brief
description of your algorithma to jartool@aig.jpl.nasa.gov.

************
* CONTENTS *
************
The specific types of data that are included in this package 
are as follows:

1. Images - 134 binary files. Each image is 
      1024 X 1024 X (unsigned) 8-bit. For convenience
      images follow the naming convention: img#.sdt
      where # is in the range [1,134]. There is also 
      an img#.spr file, which contains header
      information for the images. Images can be read
      into Matlab with the vread.m code from the Programs 
      subdirectory:

          A = vread('img1');

      Note that we have included only a small subset of the
      full Magellan dataset (30,000 images). The full set is
      available as a ~150 CD-ROM "boxed set".

2. "GroundTruths" - 134 ascii files with extension .jtri
      (one-to-one correspondence with the images). These
      files are stored in the format used by the JARtool
      programs. Ground truth files in a simpler format
      .lxyr are also provided. Each of the lxyr files
      contains a number of rows of the form:

          label x y radius 

      The quotes around "ground truth" are intended
      as a reminder that there is no absolute ground
      truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and
      the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous 
      identification of the volcanoes, even by human
      experts. The labels provide some measure of
      subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano, 
      2 = probably, 3 = possibly, 4 = only a pit is visible).
      See references [2,3,4] for more information on the
      labeling uncertainty problem.

3. Tables - This directory contains five tables.

      Experiments_Images_Table - an ascii table which for each
      experiment/subexperiment identifies the images that
      were used for training and testing. Experiments are
      designated with letters and subexperiments within
      an experiment (e.g., a particular cross-validation fold)
      are designated with a number. Ranges of images are
      specified using a notation similar to MATLAB, e.g.,
      TRN = [1:3,7,10:12]; means that images 1,2,3,7,10,11,12
      were used for training. This table is for researchers 
      using the data since it details the exact set of 
      experiments published in [1].

      Images_GroundTruths_Table - an ascii table showing the
      "true" names of the images on the JPL system and the
      corresponding ground truth names. This table is for use
      by a JPL script that was used to copy the data to the proper directories
      and rename according to the img# convention; however, the
      image names contain information about the location
      of the image on the planet and hence may be of interest, 
      e.g., f30n332_images/ff20 refers to a full-resolution Magellan 
      data product (F-MIDR) at latitude 30 degrees north, longitude 332 degrees. 
      Each product is subdivided into a 7 X 8 grid of "framelets". 
      The ff20 refers to the 20th framelet. Framelet numbering goes 
      from left to right, top to bottom. This table also contains 
      a Labeler_ID to indicate who provided each ground truth file.

      Experiments_Scoring_Table - This table shows the  total image area and
      number of usable volcano detection opportunities for each major 
      experiment. Refer to the section on Scoring below for more information.

      Images_Area_Volcanoes_Table - This table shows the usable area of
      each image and the number of usable (ground-truth) volcanoes in
      each image. A 15 pixel border around the edge of the images has
      been excluded as "non-usable". In addition, some images have large
      blank regions (zeroes), where there was a gap in the Magellan
      acquisition or communication processes. The blank areas are
      not included in the area computation. (Thin image slivers are not
      included either.) For convenience, subtotals over image area and number
      of volcanoes have been taken over the appropriate images and
      stored in the Experiments_Scoring_Table.

      Labeler_Table - This table associates Labeler_ID with a string
      identifying the labeler. Whenever available, consensus labeling
      data provided by two scientists working together is used as
      ground truth. 

4. FOA - For each experiment/subexperiment, focus of attention (FOA)
      files are provided for all images used in the training
      and testing  sets. The FOA files appear in .jtri format as well as
      a simpler .lxyv format. The .lxyv files have the following info:

          label x y value

      where label is 1,2,3, or 4 if the region matches an entry in the
      corresponding ground truth file and label = 0 if the region does 
      not appear in the ground truth. Value is the correlation value that 
      is output from the focus of attention matched filter.

      The matched filter generated from each training set appears in
      the trn subdirectory under each experiment/subexperiment. These
      files can be read in Matlab as follows:

          mf = vread('matched_filter');

      Note however that since we have implemented the FOA convolutions 
      using the separable kernel method [5], the filter read from the file 
      is not exactly the same as the one used in the FOA (95% approximation).
      Also, the matched filter is applied to a "spoiled" image that has been
      reduced by a factor of 2 in each dimension through block averaging.
      Thus, the 15 X 15 pixel filter corresponds to a 30 X 30 pixel area
      in the raw images.

5. Chips - For each experiment/subexperiment we have extracted the chips used
      for training and testing. The chips are stored in files with names
      like exp_A1_Ctrn and exp_A1_Ctst. There are also labels files with
      names exp_A1_Ltrn and exp_A1_Ltst that have the ground truth label
      for each chip. A third set of files exp_A1_Ntrn and exp_A1_Ntst
      have the image number from which each chip was extracted. This set
      of files probably provides the most convenient form for ML
      researchers interested in looking at the data. Use the vread.m utility
      provided in the Programs directory to read the data into Matlab.

6. Programs - There is a Matlab program provided that will enable you to read
      the .sdt/.spr (view format) files included in this data package. If
      you want to use something other than Matlab, you are on your own, but
      the format is fairly simple and can be understood by looking at the
      Matlab code.

7. Performance - For each experiment we provide an ROC curve showing the
      probability of detection versus the number of false alarms per
      square kilometer obtained with the baseline JARtool system. Each plot 
      shows two curves - one for the focus of attention algorithm and one 
      for the overall system. See the next section for more information on scoring.

***********
* SCORING *
***********

In order for results to be compared across systems, it is important
that scoring be performed as described in this section (obviously
computational improvements that yield the same output are
allowed). Assume that there are Nd hypothesized detections whose x and y coordinates
are stored in matlab arrays Dx and Dy respectively, and Ng ground
truths whose x and y coordinates are stored in arrays Gx and
Gy. Matlab pseudocode for scoring is as follows:

    s_thr = 13;
    d_matched = zeros(Nd,1);
    g_matched = zeros(Ng,1);

    for g = 1 : Ng
      for d = 1 : Nd
        if (sqrt( (Dx(d)-Gx(g))^2 + (Dy(d)-Gy(g))^2 ) <= s_thr)
          % Found a match
          d_matched(d) = 1;
          g_matched(g) = 1;
        end
      end 
    end

    n_false_alarms = sum(d_matched == 0);
    n_true_detects = sum(g_matched == 1);

Note that this algorithm allows (1) a single detection to match
multiple ground truths (this rarely happens because the volcanoes are
usually adequately separated from each other) and (2) a single ground
truth to match multiple detections. We mention this point because it
is tempting to place a break statement at the end of the "found a match"
block (for speed-up), but you will obtain slightly different (worse)
results by doing so.

An important aspect of scoring is that before the matching process
is performed, the detection list and ground truth list
are "filtered" to remove any entries that are too close (<= 15 pixels)
to the image border. The Experiments_Scoring_Table shows the
number of volcano detection opportunities and the image area *after*
border exclusion. This explains why the number of volcano detection
opportunities does not precisely match the number of ground truth
volcanoes.

To generate performance numbers for an experiment, n_false_alarms
and n_true_detects are each summed up over the test images used
in each subexperiment. The total number of true detects is
converted to a detection probability by dividing by the number of
detection opportunities (from Experiments_Scoring_Table). Similarly,
the total number of false alarms is converted to false alarms
per square kilometer by dividing by the total image area
(also from Experiments_Scoring_Table).

For algorithms that make graduated decisions (e.g., algorithms that
generate posterior probability estimates), it is possible to generate
an ROC curve showing the trade-off between detection probability and
false alarm rate. However, for algorithms that make only a binary decision
(e.g., a standard nearest-neighbor algorithm), only a single point
can be generated. 

For researchers who start from the JARtool FOA candidate regions or
equivalently from the Chips data, please report only unconditional
performance numbers, i.e., relative to the area and number of
volcanoes given in the Experiments_Scoring_Table, rather than
conditional numbers based on the number of non-volcanoes and volcanoes
in the FOA lists or _Ctst files.
