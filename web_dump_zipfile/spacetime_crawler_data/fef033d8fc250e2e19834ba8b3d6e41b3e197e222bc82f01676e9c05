== == '''Mac Setup Guide''' == ==
This page will guide you how to setup C++ development environment on Mac using Eclipse and how to set gdb for debugging purposes.

== '''Setup development environment using Eclipse'''==
1: Install [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 Xcode] from Mac App Store. After the installation is finished, open it and it will start installing additional necessary things. 

2: Open terminal, type "xcode-select --install". Follow the prompts to let it install necessary components (Xcode Command Line Tools)

3: Download and install [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/oxygen/1.RC4/eclipse-cpp-oxygen-1-rc4-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.dmg Eclipse for C/C++] for Mac OS X. Note: for mac users who have updated to Mac OS X High Sierra, please follow the exact link to download Oxygen 1.RC4, since it fixes a bug that won't let you run C/C++ programs in Eclipse in High Sierra.

4: Test if it works by creating a new C++ project in Eclipse. Select '''MacOSX GCC''' instead of Cross GCC.

You can check [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/eclipse.html this page] if you need more detailed instructions.




== '''Mac: Set up GDB for debugging purposes'''==

This process is pretty complicated, but GDB can help a lot when debugging.

Follow this [https://www.thomasvitale.com/how-to-setup-gdb-and-eclipse-to-debug-c-files-on-macos-sierra/ set up gdb on mac guide] to set up gdb. This guide is up-to-date with the latest Mac OS version and will work. 

If you are unclear about some steps, you can also take a look at this [https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/mac-gdb-install.html outdated guide] that won't work anymore, but still provides useful information. If this outdated guide says different things, please follow the first guide.Mis_redirected¢DtypeEvalueôIhttp_code¢DtypeEvalueÈQdownload_complete¢DtypeEvalueõ
