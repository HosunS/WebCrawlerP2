<h3>Curve-alignment problem</h3>
    <p>The focus of this toolbox is on the introduction of joint curve
    clustering and alignment algorithms. Curves are often misaligned in 
    real-world data sets. For example, the growth acceleration curves for 
    a set of boys might share a common shape or structure due to similarities 
    in human growth development but may be significantly misaligned due to 
    differences in individual growth dynamics. Clustering and prediction in 
    this situation can be difficult.
 
    <p>With this type of curve data, typically one of two sequential strategies 
    is followed: (1) clustering is followed by a within-cluster alignment, 
    or (2) the curves are first aligned globally and then clustering is carried 
    out on the aligned curves. Both of these methods are potentially suboptimal 
    since the clustering and alignment are often dependent on each other. The 
    joint clustering-alignment models in this toolbox address this problem by 
    simultaneously solving both the clustering and alignment problems using a 
    joint EM framework.



<h3>Standard regression mixture model specification</h3>
    <p>The general model specification used throughout this toolbox is based
    on the standard polynomial regression model:
             <div class="math">y = XB + e,</div>
    <p>where <span class=math>y</span> is an observed curve, <span class=math>X</span> 
    is the associated regression matrix, <span class=math>B</span> is
    a vector of regression coefficients, and <span class=math>e</span> is an error 
    term (zero-mean
    Gaussian). In the case of splines, <span class=math>X</span> is a spline basis 
    matrix and <span class=math>y</span> is the
    spline coefficient vector. 
 
    <p>If you repeat this model over <span class=mathi>K</span> cluster components 
    (or groups), then the
    resulting overall density of <span class=math>y</span> can be described 
    by a linear regression 
    mixture (LRM) model. (Some authors may choose to call this a polynomial 
    regression mixture (PRM) model if <span class=math>y</span> is a polynomial 
    in <span class=math>x</span>, but we just
    stick with the notation LRM in this toolbox.) The mixture density 
    for <span class=math>y</span>
    can be written as

    <div class="math">
              <em>p</em>(y|<em>Q</em>) = \sum_<em>k w_k N</em>(y|<em>Q_k</em>),</div>
              
    <p>where <span class=mathi>Q</span> and <span class=mathi>Q_k</span> 
    denote an appropriate set of 
    parameters for the particular
    chosen error model (Gaussian), <span class=mathi>w_k</span> is the 
    <span class=mathi>k</span>-th mixture weight, 
    and <span class=mathi>N</span>() is
    the Gaussian density (note: \sum_<span class=mathi>k</span> is just a sum 
    indexed from 1 to <span class=mathi>K</span>).
    There is a straightforward EM procedure to estimate <span class=mathi>Q</span> 
    and determine the
    cluster memberships for each <span class=math>y</span>-curve. The EM procedure iterates
    between estimating the cluster memberships and solving <span class=mathi>K</span> weighted
    least-squares problems. The algorithm for this procedure is contained in the
    function <b>lrm()</b> for this toolbox. The function <b>curve_clust()</b> provides a
    standard calling interface that should be used to call this and all other 
    EM algorithms in this toolbox.



    <h3>Curve-aligned clustering model specification</h3>
  
    <p>In brief overview, simultaneous curve alignment and clustering is accounted
    for by adding (at most) four scalar transformation variables to the above 
    regression mixtures specification. We denote these variables by 
    <span class=mathi>a,b,c</span>, 
    and <span class=mathi>d</span>. 
    Below we refer to <span class=math>x</span> as time (and refer to transformations in time) 
    and <span class=math>y</span> as 
    the measurements (and refer to transformations in measurement space).
    The transformed regression model can be written as
 
             <div class="math">y = <em>c</em>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]B + <em>d</em> + e,</div>
 
    <p>where the square brackets '[' and ']' denote the transformed regression
    matrix (discussed below). The variable <span class=mathi>c</span> 
    allows for scaling in measurement
    space, <span class=mathi>d</span> allows for translation in measurement space, 
    <span class=mathi>a</span> allows for scaling
    in time, and <span class=mathi>b</span> allows for translation in time. 
    This can be rewritten to more
    clearly separate the actions of <span class=mathi>a,b</span> and 
    <span class=mathi>c,d</span>:
    <div class="math">
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <tr><td align="center">(y-<em>d</em>)<td colspan="2">
            <tr><td>-----  <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<td>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]B + e*,<br>
            <tr><td align="center"><em>c</em><td colspan="2">
    </table>
    </div>
 
    <p>where <span class=math>e*</span> is a new error term. 
    From this equation it is clear that <span class=mathi>c</span> 
    and <span class=mathi>d</span>
    "operate" on <span class=math>y</span> (in measurement space), 
    and <span class=mathi>a</span> and <span class=mathi>b</span> "operate" 
    on <span class=math>x</span> (in time).
 
    <p>The transformed regression matrix 
    <span class=math>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]</span> can be computed 
    by applying the
    transformation <span class=math><em>a</em>x+<em>b</em></span> 
    to the observation times before 
    the regression matrix 
    is built. The standard regression matrix in polynomial regression is the
    Vandermonde matrix:
    <div class="math">
            X = (1  x  x^2  x^3 ... x^<em>p</em>),</div>
 
    <p>where <span class=math>x = (<em>x</em>_1,<em>x</em>_2,...,<em>x_n</em>)</span>' 
    and <span class=math>x^<em>m</em></span> is 
    the vector <span class=math>x</span> whose <span class=mathi>n</span> components are
    each raised to the power <span class=mathi>m</span>. Thus, in this case, 
    <span class=math>X</span> is an <span class=math><em>n-by-</em>(<em>p+1</em>)</span>
    regression matrix. Using this notation we can easily describe 
    <span class=math>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]</span> as follows:
    <div class="math">
         [<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>] = (1  <em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>  (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^2  
         (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^3  ...  (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^<em>p</em>),</div>
 
    <p>where <span class=math>(<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^<em>m</em></span>
    is the vector <span class=math><em>a</em>x+<em>b</em></span>
    whose <span class=mathi>n</span> components are each raised to the power
    <span class=mathi>m</span>.
 
    <p>If we repeat the transformed regression model for 
    <span class=math>y</span> over <span class=mathi>K</span> cluster components,
    then the resulting overall density for <span class=math>y</span> 
    is a curve-aligned regression
    mixture model. A set of linear EM algorithms (linear in the number of curve 
    measurements) that simultaneously solves for cluster memberships and curve
    alignments for this model was introduced in (Gaffney, 04). These joint
    clustering-alignment EM algorithms make up the body of what the CCToolbox
    provides. The set of cluster models/methods provided in this toolbox
    are described in the <a href="cluster_models.html">cluster models</a> section.
