published in the communes of residence of both the intended bride and
groom a few weeks before the wedding date.  The publication of banns
gave people in the community the opportunity to object to the intended
marriage.  For this, as well as other reasons, sometimes a couple will
be listed in the banns but will not be found in the marriage records.
