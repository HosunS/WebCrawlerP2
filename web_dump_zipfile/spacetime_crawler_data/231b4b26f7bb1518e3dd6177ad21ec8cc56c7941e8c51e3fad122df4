  <LI> <B>Academic Dishonesty</B>
<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI> Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected
           in the final grade (usually an F)
      <BR> because dishonesty devalues the learning experience for the whole class.
      <BR> Additional consequences may occur at the campus level.
      <LI> Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
          <UL>
            <LI> copying from others during an examination
            <LI> allowing another student to copy from your work
            <LI> communicating exam answers to other students during an examination
            <LI> using unauthorized materials during an examination
            <LI> tampering with an examination after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit
          </UL>
      <LI> For more complete information about academic honesty policies,
           consult the
          <BR>
          <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/academic-integrity/AcademicIntegrityPolicyApproved-04.23.15.pdf">Academic Senate Policy on Academic Integrity</a>

	  <LI> include your name and UCI Student ID number in the message
	  <LI> if you are not writing from your official UCI email address,
	       please cc your official UCI email address
	</UL>
	<BR> (This protocol enables me to weed out requests for help
              on problems from non-UCI students)
