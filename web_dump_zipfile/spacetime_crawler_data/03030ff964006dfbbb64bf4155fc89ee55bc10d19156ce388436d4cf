Advances in processor and wireless networking technology are
generating a new class of distributed, real-time, and embedded (DRE) systems, useful in a range
of application domains such as
avionics, biomedical devices and telemedicine, remote sensing, space exploration and command and
control. 
Developing applications for such complex DRE systems has grown not only difficult, but also
challenging in the need to satisfy performance and reliability constraints while ensuring
efficient exploration through a very large architectural design and implementation space.
The development process for these systems continue to be manually driven; the design of complex
systems is often extremely platform specific along the process, which make the resulting system
design inflexible and non-reusable.
<p>
The FORGE project is a framework for optimization of distributed embedded systems software,
with the goal of overcoming the above mentioned challenges. We integrate the middleware abstraction
layer with the hardware/OS abstraction layer and study mechanisms for capturing resources/architectures at these two levels and allowing interactions between the levels.
