<p>Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).</p>

  <tr>
    <td>F 1/25</td>
    <td>Several new sets of <a href="Notes">Notes and Examples</a> are available, along with a <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a> update.  I've also shortened the <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2">Project #2</a> write-up, mainly because the section that used to describe Memcheck in light detail has been replaced by a new set of <a href="Notes">Notes and Examples</a> that goes into a lot more detail.</td>

    <td>The first of the lab meetings have been scheduled and are now listed in the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, each helmed by one or more of our lab tutors.  These are optional, but available for you if you need help as you work on your projects.  They begin meeting on Friday, January 11.  Sometime next week, we'll add some additional hours with the course TA, as well.</td>

      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, January 8.  There are no scheduled lab sections, but we will have informal lab meetings, which I expect will begin next week, with times and days to be announced.  For more information about meeting times of lab meetings, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="NotesAndExamples">Notes and Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
