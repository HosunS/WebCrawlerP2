Critique of a Technology
</H1>

Here is the reaction which the inventor of a new technology
(call it <B>X</B>) received upon presenting it
to the leader of the enterprise which was
supposed to benefit from it.

<blockquote>
The parent or inventor of an art is not
always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own
inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who
are the father of <B>X</B>, from a paternal love of your own
children have been led to attribute to <B>X</B> a quality which <B>X</B>
cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create
forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use
their memories; they will trust to the external <B>X</B>
and not remember of themselves.

<P>
The specific which you
have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and
you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of
truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned
nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally
know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of
wisdom without the reality.
</blockquote>

Question: What is <B>X</B>?
