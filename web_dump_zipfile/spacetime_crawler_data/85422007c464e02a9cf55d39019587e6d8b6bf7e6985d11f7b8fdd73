Title of Database

msnbc.com anonymous web data

2. Data Type

Discrete sequence

This data describes the page visits of users who visited msnbc.com
on September 28, 1999.  Visits are recorded at the level of URL
category (see below) and are recorded in order.

5. Data Characteristics

The data comes from Internet Information Server (IIS) logs for
msnbc.com and news-related portions of msn.com for the entire day of
September, 28, 1999 (Pacific Standard Time).  Each sequence in the
dataset corresponds to page views of a user during that twenty-four
hour period.  Each event in the sequence corresponds to a user's
request for a page.  Requests are not recorded at the finest level of
detail---that is, at the level of URL, but rather, they are recorded
at the level of page category (as determined by a site administrator).
The categories are "frontpage", "news", "tech", "local", "opinion",
"on-air", "misc", "weather", "health", "living", "business", "sports",
"summary", "bbs" (bulletin board service), "travel", "msn-news", and
"msn-sports".  Any page requests served via a caching mechanism were
not recorded in the server logs and, hence, not present in the data.

6. Other Relevant Information

Number of users: 989818
Average number of vitis per user: 5.7
Number of URLs per category: 10 to 5000

7. Data Format

Here are the first 20 lines of the ascii data file:

% Different categories found in input file:

frontpage news tech local opinion on-air misc weather msn-news health living business msn-sports sports summary bbs travel


% Sequences:

Each category is associated--in order--with an integer starting with
"1".  For example, "frontpage" is associated with 1, "news" with 2,
and "tech" with 3.  Each row below "% Sequences:" describes the
hits--in order--of a single user.  For example, the first user hits
"frontpage" twice, and the second user hits "news" once.
