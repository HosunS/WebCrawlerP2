<A NAME="Anchor1"><B>Introduction</B></A>

<P>   Censorship of any kind is wrong and the internet is not an 
exception.    The Bill of Rights says that 
congress shall amend no law that takes away a right from the people 
specifically stated in  
the constitution.  For the government to censor people who use the 
internet is a direct violation of the Bill of Rights, as is reading 
someone's electronic mail(e-mail).  We should have a 
right to do whatever we want as long as it does not inflict harm on any 
one else.  Additionally, what is in someone's e-mail directory is their 
business and no one else's.  The government needs to understand that the 
Bill of Rights cannot be ignored where the internet is concerned.</P>

<A Name="Anchor2"><B>Issues</B></A>

<P> The internet has a variety of resources located within its realms. 
There are things like Gopher and the World Wide Web, which are
divisions of the Internet that contain even more information.  The Internet 
also contains 
Internet Relay Chat(IRC), which allows people from all over the world to 
<I>talk</I>  to each other.  There is a lot of information out there and for
the government to try to censor some of it is wrong.  That is limiting 
some of the resources and, when we start limiting our resources, we are 
possibly taking away some valuable information.  Even though the 
government may not feel that the information is valuable, it can still 
have value if other people feel it does.</P>

 <P>There is also the issue of privacy, because, in order 
for Congress to censor the internet, they will have to have access to 
everyone's account.  This is not censorship but rather and invasion of 
privacy.  What I keep in my account is my business.  Unless there is 
some way that what I have in my account can hurt someone, then the 
government has no business reading what is in it.  There is the 
problem of how the government could find out if there is 
something harmful in someone's account.  This issue of privacy recently 
came up in a case involving a guy who detailed the brutal rape and murder 
of a girl in one of his classes.  He used the girls name and detailed the 
story on IRC.  Because of this incident, the government wants to have 
access to all e-mail accounts.  That would not be legal under current 
jurisdiction, because, in June, 1967, a joint committee, comprised of 
representatives 
from the American Association of University Professors, U. S. 
National Student Association, Association of American Colleges, 
National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and National
Association of Woman Deans and Counselors, met in Washington, 
D.C., and drafted the Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of 
Students<A 
HREF="ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/academic/student.freedoms.aaup">(JSRF)</A>
The Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of Students 
proves that even if searches by the government were allowed, they 
could not possibly be very effective if they were done legally.  In 
Article VI., section B. Investigation of Student Conduct, part 1. of the <A 
HREF="ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/academic/student.freedoms.aaup">JSRF,</A>  
 it is 
clearly stated that " Except under extreme emergency circumstances, 
premises occupied by students and the personal possessions
 of students should not be searched unless appropriate authorization
 has been obtained.  Only in extreme cases could searches 
be done, therefore, there would be very few cases where the government 
would be obliged to access someone's account.  Someone's e-mail account 
is there personal possession and should fall under the rules and 
guidelines of the Joint Statement of Rights and Students.</P> 
	
<A Name="Anchor3"><B>Sites</B></A>

<P>An example of a site that might be considered for censorship is the 
<A HREF="http://www.playboy.com/playmates/playmate-mar95.html">March 1995 
Playmate page.</A>  It contains a picture of
<A HREF= "http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-mar95.jpg">Stacey 
Sanchez.</A>  If this were just a normal picture, 
then there probably would not be any problem.  This however is not a 
normal picture.  Stacey Sanchez is the March 1995 Playboy Playmate of the 
Month and the picture is a nude photograph of Ms. her.  I understand 
that many people may consider this pornography and therefore, want to ban 
the picture and/or the whole <A 
HREF="http://www.playboy.com/">Playboy</A> site itself.  There is 
nothing wrong the naked human body and therefore, nothing wrong with 
having access to  a picture of the naked human body.  I understand that 
this is a personal view, but to say that the picture is pornographic and  
should be banned is also exercising personal opinion.  The only 
difference is that the government is imposing its personal opinion on 
others.  If the government bans the picture and others like it, such as 
these nude pictures of 
<A HREF="http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-dec94.jpg">Elisa 
Bridges</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-feb95.jpg">Lisa Marie 
Scott,</A> it is 
not giving those who like these kinds of pictures a choice of whether or not 
they can 
see the pictures.  Whereas, if the government were to leave the picture 
site alone, then everyone would have a choice.  People could choose to 
either look at the picture or not.  No one is stopping them from doing 
either.  Also, if the majority of people feel that children should not be 
allowed to look at the pictures, there are steps that can be taken to 
prevent their access.  For instance, at the First Amendment Privacy 
Curtain for Ambers Playhouse<A 
HREF="http://www.infohaus.com/access/by-seller/Ambers_Playhouse">(FAPCAP),</A> the
user is asked to enter their age.  This is the equivalent of 900 numbers 
saying that children under the age of eighteen must get parent permission 
before calling or that you must be at least eighteen years of age to 
call.  Of course, someone under twenty-one could always type in that they 
are twenty-one or older, just as someone under the age of eighteen could 
call a 900 number without their parent's permission.  To stop 
unauthorized people from calling 900 numbers from their number, Pacific 
Bell allows people to put a 900 number block on their phone.  There is no 
such "block" available on the internet as yet that I have been able to 
locate, however little kids are not the ones buying the computers in most 
cases and they are also not the ones signing up for e-mail accounts, 
either.  Parents are the ones who control the use of the computers in 
their home.  If they do not want their kids to have access to material 
they deem inappropriate, then there are a few alternatives they have.   
The parents can supervise their children when they use the computer, 
they cannot let their kids know the password to their e-mail accounts, 
or they could lock the keyboard, since almost all computers have a lock 
that can be engaged when desired.  </P>

<A Name="Anchor8"><B>Benefits</B></A>

<P>The internet offers many benefits to its users.  Each of the various 
sights on the internet or the World Wide Web or Gopher has something to 
offer.  Additionally the sites that someone finds will have links to 
other sites and that site will have links and so on.  The information is 
endless and each day, more information is added.  I am a rap music fan 
and "Vibe" is a rap magazine that I like to read.  On the World Wide Web, 
there is the <A HREF="http://www.vibe.com/"><I>Vibe</I> Magazine 
Homepage.</A>  It has articles on rappers and even has clips of music 
videos.  This is only one of the many sites on the internet.</P> 

<A Name="Anchor4"><B>Agencies</B></A>	

<P>There are many agencies out there that attempt to prevent 
censorship and protect people's right to privacy, especially on the 
Internet.  One organization is the Electronic Frontiers Foundation of 
New Hampshire, <A 
HREF="http://www.efnh.org/efnh/efnhinfo.html">EFF.</A>  The EFF attempts 
"to ensure protection of freedom of speech and privacy in electronic 
communication;  to help policy-makers, the media, and the general public 
understand the online world;  and to help the citizens of New Hampshire 
gain access to government information electronically."  Organizations 
like the EFF try to watch out for ordinary internet users who otherwise 
would not know that the government is trying to take away some of their 
rights.  Without such organizations, we might not have some of the rights 
we currently enjoy.</P>
 
<A Name="Anchor5"><B>Conclusion</B></A>

<P>What is located in someone's e-mail file is their personal business. 
 It is as personal as a letter that is written.  The government does 
not have the right to read anyone's mail unless it an extreme 
circumstance and the same should hold true for an e-mail account.       
Until Congress can prove that it is possible for someone to 
be physically injured by something that they see or hear while using 
the internet, then I do not see just cause for censorship of the 
internet.  Too many people in this world rely on the internet for the 
government to censor some of the sites or some of the pictures located on 
the internet.  There are various avenues that can be taken to prevent the 
unauthorized use of the internet by those people who are underage for 
that to be an excuse.  The benefits of the internet so far outway any 
minute costs that there is no need for the government to attempt to 
censor it.   </P>

This site is about Project Censored(PC).  PC explores and publicizes the extent of censorship in our society.
Their research should help me in my search for cases of censorship on the internet.
