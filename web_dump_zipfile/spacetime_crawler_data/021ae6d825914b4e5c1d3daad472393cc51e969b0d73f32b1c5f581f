      <HR>

      <p><b>What do you do on the project?</b> I did various graphic programming jobs. I implemented a technique known as blending and another known as masking, and finally I introduced shaders and normal mapping to the hummingbirds. Most of my work is done in code, but I'm closely related to [Adobe] Photoshop and 3D Studio Max--all the actual graphics come from there.</p>

<p><b>How long have you been with the group?</b> Since spring quarter, around March.</p>

<p><b>Why are you working on the project?</b> It was very interesting to me, and it was a challenge to make the hummingbirds look good.</p>

<p><b>What do you think is the overall goal of the project?</b> The goal of the project is to set up a system to show ecology restoration but to also be implemented in a general scale so it can be placed in science centers all over the nation.</p>

<p><b>What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?</b> Probably the late-night code-a-thons.</p>

<p><b>Do you have any career goals/interests?</b> Definitely. I would like to some day work for a video game developer.</p>

<p><b>What are the other projects you've worked on?</b> I did a research project with Professor Pajarola, where I took a large model of a building and made a system to keep track of all the parts so it could rendered all in one frame on multiple PCs before being recombined into one graphics card.</p>

<p><b>Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?</b> No.</P>
