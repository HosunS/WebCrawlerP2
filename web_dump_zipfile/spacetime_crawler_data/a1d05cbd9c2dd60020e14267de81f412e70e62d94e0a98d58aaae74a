<P>Access control is something that Word Pro gives far greater control to than Word. In Word, you have document read and write permissions based on passwords, and then a document can be protected to only allow revisions or annotations, also based on a password. In Word Pro 96, you can specify quite precisely every role that every possible user has. </P>

<P></P>

<P>This is all based on a set of permissions lists. These are stored right there in the binary file format.</P>

<P>Naturally this would take some adapting if, for instance, you wanted it to work with HTML documents. Obviously you canï¿½t just store the permissions lists right there in unencrypted ASCII text. It would require considerable server-side support, and, if you wanted to implement it to the degree that Lotus does, authoring environment support. So for instance, if I call up an access-controlled file, the server would hand my editor a file, with instructions about what Iï¿½m allowed to do and not to do. If my editor cheats and lets me do things locally, the server of course still wonï¿½t let me do those nasty things to the server copy. So itï¿½s not trivial, to say the least.</P>
