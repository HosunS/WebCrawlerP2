<h3>Vavoom (the Visual Virtual Machine)</h3>

<p>
User interfaces are based on abstractions such as buttons, menus, and
other conceptual models through which they explain their
behaviours. These abstractions attempt to do two things. One is to
create a metaphorical high-level representation, building anaologies
to other domains of experience. The second is to hide implementation
details, which are the mechanism by which the abstraction is
maintained. We believe that metaphorical representations are
critically important for interaction, but that information hiding is
problematic. By hiding the detail of how the computer will respond and
react to user requests and tasks, conventional abstractions and
metaphors make it harder, not easier, for people to coordinate their
actions and use computer systems. We are exploring a range of
approaches that give users a stronger sense of how computer systems
work.
</p>

<p>
As a starting point, we wanted to investigate what kinds of visual
representations we might be able to provide of running software
systems. Focussing initially on novice programmers, we build an
extension to the Java Virtual Machine which we call Vavoom, or the
Visual Virtual Machine. Vavoom builds real-time visual depictions of
the behavior of unmodified Java class files. These visual
representations can be dynamically explored by programmers to get a
better picture of what is going on inside the software systems that
they are writing.
