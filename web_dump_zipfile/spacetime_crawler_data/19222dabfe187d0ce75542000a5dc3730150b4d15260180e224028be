<H2>Introduction</H2>
<BR>
     <P>There are many different kinds of thievery in our
society; most noticeable are the stealing of merchandise,
money, or anything else of value.  However, with the rise of
high-tech computers in the 80's and 90's, a new kind of crime
emerged along with it.  The act of stealing computer
software, known as piracy, has been growing out of proportion
in the past few years.  As a result of this, software
companies are losing billions of dollars in lost revenue
every year for which the legitimate consumer ultimately
suffers with higher prices.  Many attempts were made by both
the government and software companies to counter this trend,
but to no avail.  Time is running out and as our world
economy becomes increasingly dependent on information and
technology, protecting intellectual property is essential for
our future.  In this paper, I will explore the world of
computer piracy along with possible solutions for resolving it.</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Definition</H2>
<BR>
     <P>Computer piracy, by definition, is the unauthorized
duplication of computer software.  It can occur when a person
purchases software and duplicates it in order to give it to
their friends, relatives, or whomever.  That person can then
make more copies and give it to their friends which
perpetuates this ongoing cycle.  Another way in which
unauthorized distribution takes place is through illegal
computer bulletin board services (BBS) that distribute
hundreds of copyrighted commercial software as well as
pornography and other censored material.  Computer piracy
does not only occur between private friends and BBS's, but
also through corporate sites where an enormous number of
pirated software is distributed.</P>

<BR>
<H2>How has it come this far?</H2>
<BR>
     <P>The reason that computer piracy has become so big is
because it is so easy to get away with.  First of all, it
only takes a computer and an inexpensive blank disk in order
to duplicate the particular software for distribution.
Second, since the information on diskettes are recorded
digitally, the precision and integrity of the software's code
is always perfect.  Digital information can be copied at no
cost and with practically no detection since the 1000th copy
made of a particular software will be indistinguishable from
the original.</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Facts and Figures</H2>
<BR>
     <P>It is estimated that the software industry lost more
than $12.8 billion due to piracy with $2.2 billion in the
U.S.  alone according to the Business Software Alliance.
They also estimate that 35% of the total software in the U.S.
may be illegal, 80% in Japan, and an incredible 99% in Thailand.
With staggering figures like these, the software companies have
no other choice but to raise the prices on their software in
order to make up for the lost revenue.</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Legal Issues</H2>
<BR>
     <P>Stopping computer piracy or even controlling piracy
alone is a very difficult task as it was evident in the past
events.  At first, the government proposed and passed
different kinds of laws discouraging computer piracy.
According to the U.S. Copyright Law, computer piracy is a
federal offense and civil damages can be as much as $50,000
or more and criminal penalties include fines and
imprisonment.  This may seem like a pretty tough law, but
unfortunately people ignore it because computer piracy is
very easy to get away with.  Consequently, the government got
specific by passing a legislation that made
possessing ten unauthorized copies of a software program a
felony.</P>

<BR>
<H2>Past Failed Attempts</H2>
<BR>
<P>With new laws proving to be
ineffective, software developers tried to counter computer
piracy by developing a technique called 'copy-protection'.
They tried to outsmart software thieves by either altering
tracks on the diskette in order to make it harder to
duplicate or making the software perform 'document checks' in
which the program requests particular information from the
owner's manual of the software in order to run the program.
This would insure that the person currently running the
program is the legitimate owner.  This also eventually became
a futile attempt by software companies; highly skilled
computer hackers used their knowledge to remove the copy-
protection.  After all of this, it is evident that new strict
laws by the government nor schemes to outsmart potential
thieves by the software industry do not intimidate the
hackers any bit.</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Roots to the problem</H2>
<BR>
     <P>When trying to resolve computer piracy, you must first
look at the roots that contribute to it.  In analyzing the
causes of computer piracy that I have already mentioned,
it can be broken down to two main factors.
First, one source of computer piracy is between private
citizens (between friends and BBS's). Second, another main
source of computer piracy occurs on corporate sites.  </P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Ethics and Moral Issues</H2>
<BR>
     <P>Computer piracy is very common among private citizens.
people can make copies for their friends, family, or just
about anyone.  Unfortunately, many people innocently feel
that they are doing nothing wrong by making a few copies for
their friends.  They do not realize that they are not only
doing a disservice to themselves by breaking the law, but
also by causing everyone to suffer from the increase in
prices on future software.  When
a consumer legally purchases a piece of software from a
vendor, there is a contract that exists between the software
company and the consumer.  Most people believe that once they
have purchased software,
they own it.  This is not quite true.  In fact, what has been
purchased is the license allows the purchaser to use the
product.  The software company still owns the software.  This
lack of understanding often leads to breaches of contract
through software piracy, and in many cases the pirates are
not even aware of the illegalities of their actions.  We must
also understand that there is a mutual trust between the
consumer and the software developer; "the consumer trusts that
the software developer will develop the best possible
software along with the fairest prices and the software
developer trusts that the consumer will use the software only
in the manner for which they have purchased it" and will not
make any unauthorized copies.(SPA)</P>

<H2>Possible Solutions?</H2>
<BR>
     <P>We must educate the consumers, here and abroad, on the
legal and ethical issues of computer piracy.  Although a lot
of attention is given to the new computer technology,
computer piracy is rarely addressed in the media or in the
educational institutions.  Raising the public's awareness
about computer piracy is a very realistic proposal
and can be executed without much hassle.  One prime example
who are already executing this plan are the two major anti-
piracy organizations: Business Software Alliance (BSA) and
Software Publishers Association (SPA).  One objective for
both the BSA and the SPA is education; they want the public
to understand what computer piracy is.  In order to do this,
these organizations have printed numerous brochures about
piracy and also made public messages on television to inform
the public about what is going on.  The SPA have also set up
a 1-800# for the public in which they can call with questions
dealing with piracy and its legalities.  I believe that the
government can also take part in this by making publicized
messages on television/radio and even implement them through
education in the schools.  These are both good means of
getting the message out to the public.</P>
     <P>In dealing with big corporations about computer piracy,
I think that actions and litigation must be put forth against
them.  Non-profit organization such as the SPA are the
leading groups that help litigate and convict corrupt
corporations.  These SPA alone filed 245 lawsuits for illegal
software copying, had 332 cease and desist orders issued, had
577 organizations targeted for investigation, and fined $3.6
million in total fines to corporate sites in 1993 alone
(Brandel 12).  With these numbers, we can see that the SPA
has done a substantial job into fighting piracy for a single
organization.</P>

<H2>And the Rest of the World?</H2>
<BR>
     <P>Even if the United States succeeds in the fight against
piracy, the rest of the world still remains a big problem.
Computer piracy is even worse in Asia, Europe, and other
parts of the world.  In some countries, laws do not exist in
which the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material is
prohibited.  Even though 80% of all the software in the world
is from the United States, we cannot simply act as the "world
police" and enforce its own laws on other countries.  I
believe that the U.S. government should get involved and try
to communicate with the governments of other countries in
order to help prevent piracy abroad.  We should encourage
foreign countries to enforce its copyright laws if they do
have one and establish copyright laws if they don't have one.</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<BR>
     <P>In conclusion, when we mention the word "pirate", two
different versions of it come to our minds.  The first are
the ruthless and violent men on a ship who stole treasures
from other people hundreds of years ago.  The second thing
that comes to mind is a person that illegally duplicates
computer software without buying it.  It may be difficult to
draw a relationship from these two viewpoints, but the act
of either piracy is pretty much the same thing.  It is theft.
Both were and are illegal and both hurts the legitimate
owner.  In dealing with the piracy that occurs nowadays, many
attempts will be made in the future in trying to prevent
software piracy.  No one single solution will ever completely
stop computer piracy instantly.  However, if we look at the
different roots of piracy and try to tackle each problem one
at a time, I believe we can do the next best thing for our
future.</P>
