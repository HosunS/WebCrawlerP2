<H1>Tribal Sovereignty</H1>
<H2>by Elizabeth Whipple - eafu184</H2>
<hr>


<P>The indifferent relationship that exists with the United States 
government to American Indians tribes across the nation has been 
unresolved since the days of <A 
HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/1492.exhibit/c-Columbus/columbus.html"> 
Columbus</A>.  
Many tribes hold the government accountable for the numerous broken treaties, 
and have yet to be given a response.  The issue of tribal sovereignty will 
remain at the forefront for the Indian people and will not just <i>go 
away</i>.

<P>Sovereignty is the right to be 
<A HREF="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?autonomy"> autonomous</A> 
and have self-determination.  For 
an entire ethnicity of people to be stripped of this right, even though 
they practiced self-governance before the Europeans and the Spanish 
people came to the area which is now known as North America, it is only 
right that these people should want to regain their fundamental right to 
maintain a distinct community.

<P>Through tribal sovereignty, American Indians hold a unique status as 
citizens.  Not only are they subject to laws and procedures of the United 
States government, but to tribal governments as well.  An example of this 
is that most Americans have a Social Security number, which is a 
universal identifier; whereas an Indian person will not only have a Social 
Security number, but have a Census or Tribal Verification 
number which identifies that person as a member of a federally recognized tribe
within the United States.

<P>By means of a treaty, the U.S. government took the first steps in 
establishing a contingent relationship with American Indian tribes.  The 
first of such agreements took place during the period of the 
Revolutionary War with the group of tribes known as the
<A HREF="http://nysernet.org/oneida/treaties/1789.html"> Six Nations of the 
Iroquois Confederacy</A>, which include the
<UL>
<LI>Mohawks
<LI>Oneidas
<LI>Onondagas
<LI>Tuscaroras
<LI>Cayugas and
<LI>Senecas.
</UL>
Many of the treaties first stipulated boundary lines of what the 
government had control over, also the alliance between the two agreeing 
parties would prevent the tribes from <i>attacking</i> non-Indians or 
they would face extreme punishments. An example of the before mentioned 
agreement is the <A 
HREF="http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/~marc/geography/northam/canandaigua_treaty.html
>Pickering Treaty</A> which was drawn up in the hopes that <i>peace</i> 
would prevail between the United States and the Indian tribes of the Six 
Nations.  One of the first tribal entities to establish
<A HREF="http://nysernet.org/oneida/sovereign.html">sovereignty</A> 
within the United States was the <A HREF="http://nysernet.org/oneida/">
Oneida</A> nation.  They have continued to 
honor their side of the treaty and have remained an ally to the United 
States.

<P>Previously known as the War Department,the <A 
HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/doi.html">
Department of the Interior</A> plays an integral role in that it is 
responsible for public lands that American Indians reside on.  An 
important aspect to having tribal sovereignty is having a land base where 
self-governance can occur.  Throughout history, the government has 
designated the location and size of the land areas through treaties.  
Along the way, the agreements were adjusted or overlooked in various 
situations to benefit governmental and non-Indian purposes.  Such as:
<OL>
<LI>settlers wanting to cross Indian lands to reach <i>untouched areas</i>,
<LI>to establish settlements for farming, and
<LI>to have access to valuable resources located on tribal lands.
</OL>
These broken promises are the means by which tribal Indians have rallied 
together and have asked the United States government to honor these treaties.

<P>The Indian people have found that by educating themselves in regards to 
their own tribal history, they are then better prepared to enter into 
discussions with the government.  Individuals who are well-informed 
usually become advocates for their tribes and can succinctly retrace the 
history of broken promises.

<P>After five hundred years, the United States government still has not 
seen fit to honor treaties.  However; under the current office of 
President Bill Clinton, some remarkable steps have taken place in 
reaffirming past treaties between the U.S. government and Indian 
nations.  In April of 1994, President Clinton invited the tribal leaders 
representing over five hundred tribes throughout the United States to 
Washington D.C. and gave an address <b>"stating that federally recognized 
tribes have the sovereign authority to interact on a 
<A HREF="http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSFacts.html ">
government-to-government</A> basis directly with federal agencies."</b>

<P>It is unfortunate to realize that after hundreds of years the Indian 
people still have to make a request to the United States government for 
the right to self-determination.  It is interesting to ponder how many 
more years it will take to be granted that request with no stipulations 
attached.
