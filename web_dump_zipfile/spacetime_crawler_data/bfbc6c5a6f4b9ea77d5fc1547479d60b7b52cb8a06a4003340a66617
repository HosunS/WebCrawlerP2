				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p><img src="Mugshot_small.jpg" class="right" style="margin-top:0px;" alt="swirl" /></p>
				<h3><bold>Academia</bold></h3>
				<p>
I just earned my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Informatics Department</a> of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://www.uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>. I was advised by <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/">Alfred Kobsa</a> and mentored by my thesis committee members <a href="http://www.artifex.org/~bonnie/">Bonnie Nardi</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3">Don Patterson</a>. Prior to this, I received a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, with concentration in Human Computer Interaction.<br/><br/>

Research Areas: Privacy, Technology adoption, Use and Non Use, Location-Sharing Services, Social Media, Awareness and Collaboration Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Informatics, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Values in Design, Computer-Mediated Communication.<br/><br/>
Research Funding: My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Disney Research, Samsung, and Yahoo! Labs.
				</p>
				<h3><bold>Industry</bold></h3>
				<p>
Before coming to UCI, I worked in industry as a product manager and prior to that, as lead interaction designer. I worked on enterprise solutions to information risk problems for distributed, mobile work teams. I have experience working with customers, engaging in field work with end-users, driving the design process and managing the product requirements using an interdisciplinary approach. 				  </p>
<h3><bold>Bio</bold></h3>
<p>
Xinru holds a Ph.D in Information and Computer Science with concentration in Informatics from University of California, Irvine. Her B.S. and M.S. are in Computer Science, specialization in Human-Computer Interaction, from Stanford University. She has spent 5 years working in an information risk software start-up company leading their interaction design department and then managing the product lifecycle as product manager. Utah's Women Tech Councili chose Xinru as a top 3 finalist for their Tech award in the Rising Star category which recognizes women "driving innovation, leading technology companies, and [who] are key contributors to the community." At UC Irvine, she was awarded a 4-year Dean's fellowship and her research has been funded by Disney Research, Samsung and the Yahoo! Best Dissertation Fellowship Award. Her thesis is entitled "Factors that Influence Adoption and Use of Location-Sharing Social Media". It explores psychological and social factors that influence attitudes towards and use of location-sharing technology. Xinru has published her work in leading conferences in her field such as Ubicomp, CSCW and ICWSM. She enjoys volunteering in various community programs to encourage youth in technology.
