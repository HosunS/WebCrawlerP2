				<strong>LSM-Based Storage Management in AsterixDB.</strong>
				AsterixDB is a BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a rich feature set that sets it apart from other Big Data platforms. This project aims at improving the LSM-based storage management engine inside AsterixDB. Specially, I
				have been working on these topics: (1) design efficient LSM point lookup methods to improve the applicability of secondary indexes (2)develop new maintenance strategies for LSM-based secondary indexes and filters for efficient data ingestion and query processing (3) study flow control mechanisms to minimize stalls and variances in LSM-based storage engines

				<strong>Umzi: Unified Multi-Zone Indexing in HTAP Systems.</strong>
				The rising demands of real-time analytics emphasized the need for Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) systems which can handle both fast transactions and large-scale analytics concurrently.
				In these systems, efficient indexing is critical to enable fast lookups and transaction processing. However, indexing the distributed data in HTAP systems is highly non-trivial because of its scale and evolving nature.
				To address indexing challenges in HTAP systems, we propose Umzi, a multi-version and multi-zone LSM-like indexing method. In addition to flush and merge operations in traditional LSM-like indexes, Umzi dymamically evolves itself as data is moved from one zone to another.
			</p>

				<strong>PSpec-SQL.</strong> Organizations often share business data
				with third-parties to perform data analytics. However, one major
				concern is the privacy issue. In this project, we collaborated with
				researchers in Intel Labs China to build a privacy-integrated data
				analytic system. The system allows data owners to specify their data
				usage policies into a privacy specification, which are automatically
				checked against the submitted queries. The system is implemented on
				top of Spark-SQL.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Large-Scale Software Model Inference.</strong> Softwares are
				often built without precise models. One approach to tackle this
				problem is automatically inferring software models from execution
				logs. However, real-world software systems often produce large
				amount of logs. In this project, I combined formal methods with
				modern parallel data processing techniques, and used MapReduce to
				tackle the problem of inferring software behavioral models from
				large logs.
