<H2>File menu</H2>


<p>The File menu contains the Quit command.  </p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  This command will temporarily shut down the Applet Server, 
but a new Applet Server will be started automatically by the Hyperweb Manager. 
The reason for this is that the Applet Server must be available for applets 
at a Chimera website which is  managed by the Hyperweb Manager.</p>

<p> Applets must have this special arrangement because they may only connect 
back to the website they were loaded from.  Thus any applet which is to act 
as a Chimera client must use the Applet Server to provide the services of 
the Chimera Server. 
This is the job of the Applet Server in general, but since this implies
that the Applet Server must run while the Hyperweb Manager is
running, the Applet Server will restart after the quit command executes. </p>

<p><b>Quit</b>: This command <em>temporarily</em> shuts
 down the Applet Server.</p>


<p><b>Note</b>: The Applet Server is automatically restarted by the 
Hyperweb Manager, so even if the 
quit command is selected, the Applet Server is only temporarily shut-down.
A new Applet Server will be launched after the current Applet Server
ends executuion.</p>
