(1848 - 1931 [26 Mar Cheshvan]), son of <A HREF="homemilr.htm#PD">Pesach Dovid Miller</A>
was born in either Malcov, or Obrucna (both are in northwestern Slovakia today), or G&ouml;rlice, Galicia, in 1848, the youngest of 7 boys. At Shlomo's <I>bris</I>, Raphael Meyer, his oldest brother, was given an honor
(like <I>sandik</I> or <I>kvatah</I>). In the 1870's he immigrated south to Hungary. At Tiszakerecseny, 
he obtained papers changing his name to Sch&ouml;nfeld. He married Chaya (<IMG SRC="heb/hchaya.gif" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=31>)
(1852 - 1922 [27 Sivan]), daughter of Avrohm Hersh
Gross, who was a chassid of R. Chaim of Sanz, and one of 12 children (11 boys &amp; 1 girl).
Mrs. S.L. Mendlovic of Williamsburg has much information on the Gross family.
Shlomo &amp; Chaya had 8 children. Shlomo 
became a very affluent cattle dealer. He owned a 350 acre farm and made an annual trip
to Switzerland to purchase cows. He maintained that Swiss cows produced superior milk.
He was also an agent for the Gott estate. In 1903 (?) he moved to Hodasz, and in 1912, 
to Nyirbator, Hungary where he lived a healthy life until his passing. In the fall of 1931 he developed a blockage in
his intestine. Realizing that his end was near he summoned the family to his bedside. (My grandfather and great-uncle [Naftuli &amp; Shabsi Yitzchok] came from the Kaliva (Nagykallo) Yeshiva by train that Thursday night. Chava Israel was also there). He passed away that night, November 5, 1931, surrounded by his family (he had a <I>minyon</I>). He is buried in Nyirbator 
and several years ago his descendants, Chava Israel and Miriam Werczberger, had his grave site restored.
