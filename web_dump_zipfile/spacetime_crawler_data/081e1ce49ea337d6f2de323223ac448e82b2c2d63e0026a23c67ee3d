<b>Beall Student Design Competition at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering</b> <br/>
Offered to encourage the creation of new technologies, or solutions to current design
problems that have the potential for commercialization. Ideas and products are
evaluated on their technological merits as well as potential to impact the marketplace.
Students are encouraged to submit new product ideas that involve the development of
hardware and devices. Products that entail integration are acceptable as long as there is
a substantial development effort.

<p>
The competition is open to all UCI students. Teams must be composed of at least two (2)
students, one (1) of which must be enrolled at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering.
