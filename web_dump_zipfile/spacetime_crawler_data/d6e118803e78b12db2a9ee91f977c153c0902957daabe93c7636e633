<a name = "Help"><h3>Course Help</h3>

<b>Instructor Office Hours</b>: 
Please feel free to drop by any time during my office hours, without an
  appointment (these are <b>open office hours </b>).
I cannot provide much debugging help if there are many students waiting to see
  me (better to see a TA/Lab tutor for debugging help; if you must see me,
  come prepared with a good understanding of the specifications for the problem
  and a good understanding of the code you wrote, including where/how it is
  failing).
If you cannot make any of these times and want to schedule an appointment at
  some other time, e-mail me to arrange one (or, if the question is small,
  just send me e-mail asking it, or better yet post it in a Piazza folder).
<p>

<b>Instructor Email</b>:
I answer e-mail periodically throughout the day (from about 6:30am to 10:00pm).
If you have a question that would be of interest to the entire class, please
  post it on the appropriate Piazza Message Folders (see below).
<p>

<!---
<b>Instructor Online Hours</b>: 
I will hold online evening office hours every weekday evening before our class
   meets (Monday-Thursday, 9:00pm to 10:00pm) where I am reachable by my AIM
   handle, <b>richardepattis</b>.
<p>
--->

<b>Piazza Q&A Messages</b>: 
I have created a class on
  <a href="https://piazza.com/uci/winter2019/ics33" target="main">
  Piazza</a>
 and started <b>eight categories</b> of
  <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jpx38n0gvzf2kp" target="main">
  Message Folders</a> (see below).
I prefer students ask questions in these Folders, so that everyone (staff and
  other students) can see the questions and everyone can participate in
  answering the questions (and exploring the answers).
I expect students to read these Folders regularly to keep current on
  their discussions.
Avoid duplicate posts: before posting, first check whether another student has
  already posted on that topic.
<p>
When you do post a question,
   <b>choose the right folder and a clear, specific and descriptive summary</b>.
Also, <b>do not post anonymously</b>.
I will not answer anonymous questions.
As the instructor, I can see who posts every question, but students cannot see
  this information, if you post "anonymously".
It is sometimes hard to ask a good question: clearly stating what you know and
  zeroing in on what the problem is; spend some time thinking how to describe
  your problem clearly.
"Own" your posting by attaching your name to it.
<ol>
<li>Folder <b>program</b> (1-5):
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the programming assignments: specification,
  relevant Python, etc.
<b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b> until after these programs are due,
  but feel free to ask about/discuss all other aspects of the programming
  assignments (including asking for clarification, input/output examples,
  etc: be specific).
<p>
<li>Folder <b>quiz</b> (1-8):
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the quizzes (written and programming).
  <b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b> until after these quizzes are due,
  but feel free to ask about/discuss all other aspects of the quizzes 
  (including asking for clarification, input/output examples, etc: be specific).
<p>
<li>Folder <b>in_lab</b> (1-2):
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the in-lab exams.
  <b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b> until after these in-lab exams are
  finished, but feel free to ask about/discuss all other aspects of the in-lab
  exams.
<p>
<li>Folder <b>python_and_eclipse</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the Python Programming
  Language, the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, or how to use them
  together.
<p>
<li>Folder <b>lecture_material</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the readings and the
  materials discussed in class.
<p>
<li>Folder <b>midterm</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the midterm exam.
  <b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b> until after the midterm exam is
    finished,
  but feel free to ask about/discuss all other aspects of the midterm exam.
<p>
<li>Folder <b>final</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the midterm exam.
  <b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b> until after the final exam is
    finished,
  but feel free to ask about/discuss all other aspects of the final exam.
<p>
<li>Folder <b>find_programming_partners</b>:
Find a programming partner. Relevant information is your Lab (partners should
  at least have labs meeting at the same time), approximate skill level (best 
  to match with someone your own level), work habits (e.g., prefer to work days,
  evenings, weekends; do/don't want to work early to get extra for early
  submissions), preferred location to work (if your dorm/home, say where that
  is), ...
</ol>
Feel free to ask questions and answer other students' questions in these
  Folders (subject to the prohibition of posting code for
  <b>programs, quizzes, and exams</b>).
I will read all Folders early every morning and answer all unresolved questions.
<p>
Before you post a question, check whether that question has already been asked;
  if it hasn't, choose the <b>Folder</b> in which to put it and the
  <b>Summary</b> line carefully, so that potential readers see a context and
  overview of its contents.
<p>
In past quarters, Piazza has seen a good amount of traffic: course material has
  been clarified, questions have been asked and answered, and many interesting
  discussions have ensued.
But the efficacy of these discussions depends on <b>your</b> participation.
If the need for other Folders arise, I will create them: feel free to suggest
  other Folders to me.
<p>
<b>I will not answer questions posted anonymous.</b>
Asking questions is an art; think carefully and by posting questions that you
  take ownership of (with your name) you will improve your ability to post
  questions.

<!---
<b>MessageBoard Forums</b>: 
I have created a Message Board for this class and started five 
  <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m19450/" target="main">
  MessageBoard Forums</a> (see below).
I prefer students ask questions on these Forums, so that everyone (staff and
  other students) can see the questions and everyone can participate in
  answering the questions (and exploring the answers).
I expect students to read these Message Boards regularly to keep current on
  their discussions.
Avoid duplicate posts: before posting, first check whether another student has
  already posted on that topic.
When you do post a question,
   <b>choose a clear, specific and descriptive Title</b>.
<ol>
<li><b>Python and Eclipse</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the Python Programming
  Language, the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, or how to use them
  together.
<p>
<li><b>Lecture Material</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the readings and the
  materials discussed in class.
<p>
<li><b>Quizzes and Exams</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the quizzes and
  exams (written and programming).
  <b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b>, but feel free to ask
  about/discuss all other aspects of the quizzes and exams (including asking
  for clarification, input/output examples, etc: be specific).
<p>
<li><b>Programming Assignments</b>:
Ask/answer/discuss questions about the programming assignments: specification,
  relevant Python, etc.
<b>DO NOT post solutions or any code</b>, but feel free to ask
  about/discuss all other aspects of the programming assignments (including
  asking for clarification, input/output examples, etc: be specific).

  submissions), preferred location to work (if your dorm/home, say where that
  is), ...
</ol>
Feel free to ask questions and answer other students' questions on these
  forums (subject to the prohibition of posting code for
  <b>Quizzes and Exams</b> and  <b>Programming Assignments</b>).
I will read all Forums early every morning and answer all unresolved questions.
Before you post a question, check whether that question has already been asked;
  if it hasn't, choose the <b>Title</b> line carefully, so that any potential
  reader sees an overview of its contents.
<p>
In past quarters, the message board/forum mechanism have seen a good amount of
  traffic: course material has been clarified, questions have been asked and
  answered, and many interesting discussions have ensued.
But the efficacy of these discussions depends on <b>your</b> participation.
If the need for other forums arise, I will create them: feel free to suggest
  other forums to me.
--->

<p>
<b>Course Email</b>:
The instructor, staff, and all students registered for the course can send
  email to everyone else by emailing the address
  <a href="mailto:ics33-W19@classes.uci.edu">ics33-W19@classes.uci.edu</a>.
All messages sent via this email address will be archived on the
  <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/w19/36110/" target="main">
  Email Archive</a>
As the instructor, I will frequently use this mechanism to broadcast timely
  information to all the students.
Students should use this email address more selectively: mostly you should be
  using the Piazza Folders mentioned above to ask questions, so all students
  can see your questions/comments and participate in the discussion.
One reasonable student use of this email list is to send email if Checkmate
  (the program submission system) appears to be down; by sending class email on
  this topic, I will learn about the problem, other students in the class will
  learn about the proble, and everyone will know I know about the problem.
In such a case (when I bring Checkmate back up), I'll send a follow-up email
  message to everyone.
<p>

Finally, remember to read the
  <a href="announcements.html" target="main">Announcements</a>
  link daily, on the course web; I tend to post long-lived information here,
  rather than via Piazza or email.

It is well known (but often underappreciated) fact that consistent attendence
  of lectures/lab is strongly correlated with good course performance;
  therefore, I expect all my students to attend lectures and labs regularly.
Plan on arriving punctually -I may make important announcements at the start of
  a lecture- paying attention, and treating your classmates with respect.
<p>
If you do miss a lecture, your first point of contact should be other students
  who attended the lecture to determine what you missed and how you can catch up
  (see the course web too).
One of the most "bewildering" questions faculty hear is,
  "I missed lecture yesterday; did you say or do anything important?"

As a lecturer at UCI, my primary responsiblity is teaching; my primary
  activities are preparing course materials, teaching in class, interacting
  with students (in class, during <!--[online]--> office hours, on Piazza)
  and grading.
