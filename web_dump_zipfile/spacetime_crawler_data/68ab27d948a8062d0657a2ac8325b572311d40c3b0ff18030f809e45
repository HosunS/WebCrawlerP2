    <td height="164" colspan="2" class="normalFont"><p>Republican voters on March 2 will choose their party's nominee for the 70th Assembly district. Among the six candidates vying for the open seat is UCI student Chonchol Gupta, who, while not a frontrunner, has launched a full-time campaign and earned compliments from his fellow candidates.</p>
      <p>Tuition hikes motivated Gupta, 20, to enter the local political scene. When a few of Gupta's friends could not continue their studies at UCI due to the recent university-wide fee increases, Gupta decided to run for office in hopes of effecting change.
      <p>ï¿½I feel that UCI students should elect me because I'm the candidate most in touch with educational issues,ï¿½ said Gupta. ï¿½I'm the candidate that will listen to the concerns and needs of the students and stand up to those in Sacramento who feel that it is okay to destroy the principles of the University of California.ï¿½
      <p>Along with opposing the tuition fee hikes, Gupta proposes a five-step economic recovery plan that begins with mending the educational system in order to produce a capable workforce. Gupta also proposes assigning tax identification numbers to all Californian workers as an alternative to issuing driver licenses to illegal immigrants.
      <p>Some think that Gupta's political endeavors are uncommonly bold for his age.
      <p>ï¿½He's extremely ambitious for his age,ï¿½ said Gina Mack, a 3rd year student in Film and Media Studies and Sociology. ï¿½He's not just a politician, but an all-around student.ï¿½
      <p>Not everyone considers Gupta to be a true candidate, due to his age and his limited campaign resources. According to Gupta, he was not invited to speak at a meeting of the Newport Beach Republican Assembly last November because he was not considered a major candidate.
      <p>ï¿½I've learned that most people do respect a candidate, regardless of their age,ï¿½ said Gupta. ï¿½But I've also learned the hard side of politics and that some people are ignorant of the fact that the students of this country are the future of this country.ï¿½
      <p>Chuck DeVore, one of the frontrunners in the race, thinks that Gupta's early involvement in politics is commendable.
      <p>ï¿½I am absolutely delighted with Chonchol's run for State Assembly,ï¿½ DeVore said. ï¿½He reminds me a lot of myself at that age: well-versed in the issues, intense, passionate, and full of optimism.ï¿½
      <p>Pledging to refuse special interest money, Gupta relies on a campaign team of volunteers and a campaign web site (www.choncholdgupta.com) to build grassroots support and to relay his message to the public.
      <p>Gupta has also participated in debates with his Republican rivals and on January 21st, squared off against candidates Donald Wagner, Marianne Zippi, and DeVore on his home turf in a debate sponsored by the UCI College Republicans.
      <p>ï¿½I was impressed with the content of Chonchol's presentation because it showed intelligent analysis of the issues,ï¿½ said Zippi. ï¿½My suggestion to him would be to work with groups and associations in his community where voters will have a chance to get to know him.ï¿½
      <p>College Republicans President Bryan Zuetel thinks that Gupta is already making headway with the student community.
      <p>ï¿½Chonchol brings important student issues to the race not mainly addressed by traditional candidates,ï¿½ said Zuetel.
      <p>If elected, Gupta would set the record as the youngest assemblyman in California history. Gupta would also have to take a hiatus from his college studies.
      <p>ï¿½I'd have to take a leave for two years while [I'm] in Sacramento,ï¿½ said Gupta, who added: ï¿½Hopefully by the time I would return to UCI, I wouldn't have to pay as much in tuition as I do now.ï¿½</p></td>
