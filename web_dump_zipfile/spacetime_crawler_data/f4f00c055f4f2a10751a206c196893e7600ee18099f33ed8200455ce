"<b>Engineering Software Design Processes to Guide Process Execution</b>"</A>,

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Using systematic development processes is an important characteristic of 
any mature engineering discipline. In current software practice, Software 
Design Methodologies (SDMs) are intended to be used to help design 
software more systematically. This paper explicitly shows, however, that 
one well-known example of such an SDM, Booch Object Oriented Design (BOOD), 
as described in the literature is far too vague to provide specific guidance 
to designers, and is too imprecise and incomplete to be considered as a 
fully systematic process for specific projects. 

<P>
To provide more effective and appropriate guidance and control in software 
design processes, we applied the process programming concept to the design 
process. Given two different sets of plausible process requirements, we 
elaborated two more detailed and precise design processes that are 
responsive to these requirements. We have also implemented, experimented 
with, and evaluated a prototype (called Debus-Booch) that supports the 
execution of these detailed processes.
