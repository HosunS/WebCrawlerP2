        <p>
        I am an Associate Professor of Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. My research interests lie in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Health Informatics. In particular, I am interested in designing and evaluating interactive systems for clinical documentation, patient-provider interaction and personal information management during chronic care. I received my PhD degree from the iSchool at Drexel University in 2008, and a Bachelor of Medicine degree from China Medical University in 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
        My research aims to provide empirical, conceptual, and theoretical understandings of information practices in healthcare through <em>in situ</em> examination of how healthcare providers and consumers, e.g. patients and caregivers, interact with computerized technologies in their daily lives or work practices. I have done extensive research exploring sociotechnical impacts and design issues of electronic health records systems, and more recently, patient-facing applications, such as personal informatics tools and chronic disease management systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently, I am Director of the Undergraduate Minor Program in health informatics. Since Fall 2016, I have served as Vice Chair for Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Informatics.

        <p>
		I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) currently working with Kai Zheng and Yunan Chen in the Health and Informatics (HAI) Lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Health Informatics, and Social Computing. My research focuses on the unintended users, uses, and consequences of consumer-facing technologies, such as mobile applications and social media, in the context of health (e.g., fitness, nutrition) and mental health (e.g., wellness, eating disorders, depression). By understanding the use and impact of these technologies, I aim to make improvements to technology design, education interventions, and healthcare in order to positively affect users' health. Prior to working as a postdoctoral fellow, I obtained my PhD in Information Sciences and Technology and my BS in Psychology at Penn State. In addition to my research at UCI, I am also serving as a Research Advisor for the iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3).

        <p>
        As a researcher, designer, and engineer, my research is mainly grounded in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Work, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. I aim to apply social psychology theories in mobile technologies to enhance human welfare. I first gather user requirements using qualitative methods, and then implement system interfaces and functions with standard design and development tools. I evaluate the systems by conducting longitudinal studies using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. I received my Ph.D. in Computer and Communication Sciences from the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland in 2015. My supervisor was Dr. Pearl Pu, the director of Human Computer Interaction Group. Before that, I received my Master's degrees in Security and Mobile Computing from both Aalto University in Finland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Norway in 2010 and Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China in 2008. I was a research intern in the headquarter of Nokia Research Center in Helsinki in 2009 and 2010. </p>

			As we begin to interact with computers in more numerous and complex ways, as well as use automation in contexts that we never have before, how can we best manage the strengths of artificial and human intelligence to enhance people? Understanding technology through the lens of design for usability and productivity can help generate best practices for the effective use of automation.

			As an MD-PhD student at University of California, Irvine, I am interested in studying technology use in the healthcare setting and creating tools that will better enable healthcare providers to focus on the most important part of medicine: caring for the patient.

        I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Utah. But I have the same computer problems as anyone else. Computer problems aren't a matter of intelligence, they're a matter of ergonomics: How well does the interactive software fit the user's needs and expectations?</p>
        
        <p>
        Physicians have computer problems, too, and that can make the difference between life and death for a hospitalized patient. That's why I'm studying health informatics as a doctoral candidate at UC Irvine: to help physicians help patients, by helping designers to create better interactive software.</p>

        Prior to my position at the University of Michigan, I completed my PhD in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. My PhD dissertation is titled, "Learning from Users' Adaptation Experience: Outlining the Design Space for Health IT Systems‚Äù (advised by Yunan Chen). I previously earned a Master Degree at Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor degree at Ewha Women‚Äôs University, Seoul, Korea.</p>
