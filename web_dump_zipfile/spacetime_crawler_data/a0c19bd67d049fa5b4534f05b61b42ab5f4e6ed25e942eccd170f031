 Ahhh Moishe, you bloody geneologist!

 I knew that if I included you on my email list of good wishes it would
 never be the end of it!!!

 dmlangsa @email.uncc.edu
 is Deborah Langsam a teacher we have had some minimal communication.

 mlangsam @surfer.xti.com
 is Marc an LA graphic artist about my age (45) with his own website. We
 have emailed each other a few times

 langsam @fas.harvard.edu
 is Melissa Rose Langsam who I think is a daughter of Oscar of Rehovot
 Isrtael and  an undergarduate at Harvard who is unfortunately proud of
 being a Republican, which I discovered in her last email to me and having
 said what I think of Republicans may never wrote to me again.

 By the way, I now have a family and geneology page added to my site with 

 link to yours.

 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dingonet

 go to the bottom of the page and follow the links.

 bestest regards for Pesach,

 David


 The REAL Langsam are all Communists Socialists Bundists and Labor 
movement
 supporters, apart from my cousin Allan, who is a very nice guy but has
 strayed from the flock.

my name is melissa langsam. i am daughter of david edward langsam, son of
nathan langsam, son of david mordechai langsam. i don't know the name of
that david's father. all of the above mentioned generations have lived in
america. it is through them that i fit into the langsam family tree.

curious you didn't get our illustrious last name. it always makes for a
good laugh when you're with germans...

 Hi,
 Was your grandfather Nathan a lawyer, married to Annette? Were his

 If not, can you supply some timeframe and where David Mordechai lived

nathan and annette are my grandparents, he was a lawyer, and his parents

i certainly do know other langsams. tell me what holes you have in the
family tree, and i'll see if i can help (or maybe my father could). btw,
is this a hobby for you? (you know, there is a book of this stuff that
we have at home, it's a langsam-spira family tree book. it's very
incomplete on my section of the family though). what do you do for a

It is indeed a connection.  You are connected to me by the marriage of Nathan 
Langsam to Annette Kwestel (a cousin to my maternal grandmother).  Their son 
David would I am sure be very interested to hear from you.  He would have 
more info on his father's side than I have.  I don't have an email address so 
please write to him:

David Langsam

I would be happy to hear if you reunite some family members.  

Good luck,

moishe,


i am confused. i can't open &quot;the email from melissa langsam&quot; -- what am i
supposed to find there? what did i send you that would be of interest? 


also to help with details: my grandfather, nathan, was one of six boys.
the girl died very young, and there was no harry. (also, if you want to
list the boys in chronological order -- email my father and he'll give
it toyou in order.) oldest is bill, then nat. youngest two are abe and
then phil i believe. i think ben was older than sidney, but ask my dad
(melinsss@aol.com)


it my grandmother
annette who had a brother harry, one named paul, and a sister sara(h?).


who is this dorene doyle? sounds irish, no? i'll have to read on to figure
out who i'm descended form, i've never heard of any of these people before

i do indeed know russell and his little brother peter (who's not so
little). no, no chance of an estranged brother. those six were tight!
unlike their children (my father's generation) which isn't so close, but
basically all still live in the new york area. my generation seems even
less cohesive emotionally and geographically.


ah, south street seaport is a lot of fun.:) i'm in boston for the time
being, not sure when i'll next be in new york. it might be useful for your
project (and general interest) to meet the rest of my family though. my
parents are both in new rochelle, and my father tends to go into manhattan
for meetings about once a week. 


hope this helps,

sidney married pauline, they had two sons david mordechai and ira. neither
one ever married, but david has an adopted son, also a peter langsam.
(this peter is colombian and catholic). i think david actually also
legally changed his name, and may have even become catholic in the last
few years. 

i have no idea about anyone going back farther than my grandfather's
generation. all i know about my father's grandfather david (besides his
being my father's namesake) is that he was a buttonhole maker in new york,
was really into baseball, pretty lenient about his orthodoxy.

newsletter, i was supposed to visit them when i was there in august, it
didn't work out though. no idea about anyone else. yahoo people search

moishe,


i'm confused about who you mean by "us"--? what hospital is this? and if
you don't mind my asking, why do you take your daughter to the hospital
every tuesday? how old is she?


my sister (nina, freshman at princeton) is a pre-med. she's been spending
her intersession interning at a hospital down in new brunswick. she seems
to find it very inspiring. the nathan langsam generation -- the bros were
essentially all doctors and lawyers. today would actually be my
grandfather's 97th birthday.


shabbat shalom!

Moishe,  I would assume that the person who authorized the tombstone knew what
the man's name was  AND that since the family member knew his name to be Shaje
that this is likely to be more accurate than what we had.


I had a call via Yedidyah from Simcha Langsam from Boro Park last weekend.  I
finally connected with him last night.  He says that his family has a book
without the section covering L2.  He is the son of Moishe Langsam....I'm not
sure if he is from the first or second marriage.  In any event, he's all
excited and wants to provide more information and to correct some errors.  He
couldn't talk long and will call me back for a longer conversation.  I think
that after sending him a book, I will suggest that he call you.   Suzan

Moishe,


I thought you should see this before thinking you would have a "live
one."  Dan had no New Yorkers in his immediate line and I can't imagine
why he would want to work through all the complexities of  the various
New York resources to research a family which might not even be
related.  I didn't do any New York research to speak of.  That was
Estelle's contribution.  You can deduce which records she saw by the
information she collected for the H branches.  I'm sorry I can't be any
more helpful with this but I just don't have time to consider the issue.

Suzan,
I'm so sorry that I didn't get back to you earlier, but I really want to
thank you for the information that you sent me.  I was happy to see both
familiar and new names on the tree, particularly my great-grandfather's; as
I'd mentioned, neither my father nor his sister was aware of it.  My parents
also recall some names of relatives that don't seem to fit in anywhere--
when I get some time (or 'if', the way things have been going), I will try
to trace them down and figure it out.  I hope that you are doing well and
haven't been hit too hard by the weather...  Moi, I just began a fresh batch
of classes and got a new job working in a lab, so I've been keeping quite
busy, but I'm enjoying it.  Anyway, I will keep you posted if I find
anything new about the maverick cousins.  Take care...

various New York sources....wills, court records, naturalizations, birth, marriage
and death.  Gradually, she fed Michael Cohen or me the information that she
gathered.  It was placed on the computer by Michael.  Sometimes Estelle was able to
make connections by piecing things together when she got to a cemetery and found
people buried next to each other.  Sometimes the records themselves revealed family
connections.  Sometimes they didn't.


When they didn't make the connections, Estelle didn't go beyond what she knew from
records.  In a very few cases, we were able to find living people connected to a
tree and went from there to gather more information.  In the years preceding and
following the book's publication, I developed inforamtion from Galician records,
both from mail and on the ground during my visit there.  Estelle was with me and
she participated in this collection process. We had no idea how people were related
to the main tree....or if.  We merely went on the basis of the Langsam name.


After the book came out, I wrote to a couple of places in New York and gathered
some 1915 and 1925 New York census records that supplemented some 1880, 1900 and
1920 Federal census records.  The resulting information didn't help much.


When the book was published, a small number of H families got hold of me or Michael
or Yedidyah and provided some additional information.  Daniel's family continues to
surface from time to time with scraps of information but those who really knew
anything are all gone now and I think we are at the end of the trail there.   Even
Daniel's parents knew less than was in the book!


Finally, the process of finding additional information will almost certainly have
to come from people who are alive.  There simply are no records for any of the
towns where family lived.  New York and other US records may be able to help us
make connections but I'm convinced that we will learn very little of value.  I'm
not impressed with the knowledge of any of the people you contacted the other year
through the internet.


Meanwhile, the main body of the family is pretty well finished.  There are issues
to be resolved with respect to L2 and L4.  I think that this is where we should put
our energies but of course, Yedidyah is still not thrilled with confronting the
issue and I don't see how the book can move forward with so little.


There is no ...repeat...no evidence that any of the H fragments are related to the
main body of the tree...we have no one aware of their connection to Pesach or the
Spiras.  We have nothing except the Langsam name and some hazy beliefs that we must
be related because of the name.  I've spent a lot of hours poring over the H
sections instead of focusing on my own branch and I'm wondering why I've done
that.   I need to rethink my priorities with respect to the tree and the overall
project.


Back to H9:  the family involving Esther Jacobs has never been cooperative in
providing information or responding to letters.  I don't know how it was concluded
that Isaac was involved.

Moishe,


I apologize.  I know you are just responding to what 's coming into you
and you are trying to be helpful to people.  I can't tell you how
irritating it is for me this many years later to have to go over all
this old ground.  But I will try.


H 1 and H9 are probably closely related.  Either Isaac and Mendel were
brothers or otherwise closely related.  They lived very close together
at some point. There is much to suggest that they are related.  A number
of years ago,  Ruby Jacobs called me to say that she had seen the book
somewhere.  She wanted to tell me that we had forgotten Isaac and
Gittel's (H9) daughter Esther who married a man named Jacobs.  She
couldn't remember her father in law's first name (?????Excuse me???).
Ruby's husband was Esther's son, Irving.  Irving was said to be named
after his grandfather, Isaac.  He was deceased.  She gave me a phone
number but when I tried it at a later point, it was no longer good.  She
had some additional information about David's son, Sidney.  Sidney's
wife was named Pauline.  She also said that Sarah had married a Blasberg
and they had two sons:  Sylvan and Harold.  I had addresses but neither
answered a letter.  I had Harold Blasberg's phone number in Valley
Stream but I doubt that I ever called him.


Sidney, by the way, was still living in 1999:  80 E. Hartsdale,
Hartsdale, NY 10530.  914 761-1689.


I have Phillip Langsam's Brooklyn death certificate which gives his
parents as David L. and Rose nee Freudenfall.  The information came from
Nathan, brother and the burial is at New Montefiore in Pinelawn.  Issac
and Gittel were in the census with some children in 1900.  See the page
in the book. I know that Estelle found all sorts of wills and
naturallization records about members of this family.  I found a record
about Abraham's son, Paul, who was the subject of an ugly court case as
his parents were divorcing. In that record, it was revealed that he was
retarded.  And then, I found a note about his death.


Turning to H1:  it is possible that Esther Jacob was on Mendel's tree,
not on Isaac's.  Ruby Jacobs didn't know anything except that her
husband had been related to all of these fancy doctors and lawyers.  She
was the one who told me that Irving was related to them and I accepted
her information at face value.


H1 folks know next to nothing about their family history.  And, by the
way, could care less.  I've been in touch with many people from H1 over
the years.  But, there is no Yeshaya that I know of in their family
history.


As to Yeshaya:  Just because a man's name was Isaac as his street name
in New York doesn't mean his Hebrew name was not Yeshaya.  Isaac Yeshaya
even.  But for sure the father in H9 was in the 1900 census as Isaac.
And in the records of his children as they died.


There are many Shaye's in the Langsam family.  The question is where
does he fit with the people whom you have knocking at your door.  Make
them work a little....like documenting their own family history.  Don't
assume that we have information about them.  There are many Langsams
about whom we have nothing.  They may not be IN THE BOOK!

and trying to transform my thesis into a publishable book (keep your
fingers crossed for me!)


if you plan to be in either austin or jerusalem, be sure to let me know!
