<h1>
The Simplex Algorithm is NP-Mighty
</h1>
<h2>
Will Devanny
</h2>

<p>
We propose to classify the power of algorithms by the complexity of the
problems that they can be used to solve. Instead of restricting to the
problem a particular algorithm was designed to solve explicitly, however, we
include problems that, with polynomial overhead, can be solved â€˜implicitlyâ€™
during the algorithmâ€™s execution. For example, we allow to solve a decision
problem by suitably transforming the input, executing the algorithm, and
observing whether a specific bit in its internal configuration ever switches
during the execution.
  We show that the Simplex Method, the Network Simplex Method (both with
  Dantzigâ€™s original pivot rule), and the Successive Shortest Path Algorithm
  are NP-mighty, that is, each of these algorithms can be used to solve any
  problem in NP. This result casts a more favorable light on these
  algorithmsâ€™ exponential worst-case running times. Furthermore, as a
  consequence of our approach, we obtain several novel hardness results. For
  example, for a given input to the Simplex Algorithm, deciding whether a
  given variable ever enters the basis during the algorithmâ€™s execution and
  determining the number of iterations needed are both NP-hard problems.
  Finally, we close a long-standing open problem in the area of network flows
  over time by showing that earliest arrival flows are NP-hard to obtain.
