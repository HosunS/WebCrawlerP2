I am unaware of any family connection to the Miller
family.  Most of my Langsam relatives are no longer
living.  My grandfather's name was Isidore Langsam. 
That's as far back as I go.  If you think there is a
connection between our families, let me know.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to reply to my note. There are several 
Isidore Langsam's in the tree already. If I had to guess, could it be 
Isidore married to Jenny with children Ralph and Abraham (at least). 
If not, can you tell me your grandmother's name and about when they 
came to the US?

Thanks again!

Moishe

You've got the right Isidore!  My father was Abraham;
he had two brothers, Ralph and Solomon.  Do you have
any other info re my grandfather or my grandmother
Jenny?

Hi,

Thank you again for responding to my query. I will lay out what I know.

Isidore came to the USA as an unmarried man, on 19 Oct 1906 aboard the 
ship Pretoria. His last residence (permanent) was Krakow. He was going 
to his brother Adolf (Abraham) Langsam, 127 Forsyth St, NYC. He was born 
in Krakow. Based on ship records and a letter whose details an earlier 
researcher published, Adolf, Anna, Ida, and Isidore were siblings. Their 
mother was Ruje and their father Selig, from Krakow. Isidore's Jewish 
name was Izak (Yitzchok). 

According to US vital records and the Jewish Records Indexing - Poland 
project, Izak was born July 8, 1888. More vital records data regarding 
his birth can be found on Akt 401 in film 1895667 (at a local Family 
History Center) which records Krakow Births from 1888. Let me know if 
you are interested in this. Based on his March 18, 1916 Brooklyn 
Naturalization, his wife was Jenny, born in Tarnow (now in Poland), 
listed as being 28 years old (1888?). They had two children at the time,
Ralph, born in Newark, NJ on Feb 7, 1911, and Abraham in Brooklyn on 
March 14, 1914. His occupation was "Hatter". His witnesses were Herman 
Rosenberg and Harry Kleinhandler, both hatters.

Returning to Izak's siblings - Adolf, Anna, and Ida were already mentioned. 
Ida was widowed and came to the US in 1920, age 28. her late husband's name 
seems to have been Nachemie. Another  sibling seems to have been Goldie, 
born in 1883, came to the US in 1908. Also one of Izak's sisters married 
Jacob Schultz of NY. The other Krakow birth records that seem to match in 
name or time frame are:
LANGSAM Abraham, born 1884 Akt 369 film 1895666                   
LANGSAM Chana, born 1886 Akt 291 film 1895666                   
LANGSAM Izak, born 1888 Akt 401 film 1895667                   
LANGSAM Abraham Abe, born 1889 Akt 260 film 1895667.

Isidore's brother, Adolf, married Gussie (Jewish name Malka) and had 
three children. Leo, David Schmuel and Rosalind (married to Louis 
Quaytman). David's children are Howard Earl (Jewish name Tzvi Hersh) 
and Louis (Jewish name Levi [Eli]Melech). Louis, married to Bryna 
Schneider, has two children, Michael and Elisa. In 1986 he was living 
in Seal Beach, CA.

Please share some detail regarding your own family and what you might 
know regarding Isidore (Izak)'s offspring and other siblings. 

Also of interest, do you know of any other Langsam cousins, outside of 
the offspring of Isidore (Izak) or his siblings. This will help to 
possibly connect other branches of our tree. 

I have some of this data scanned in, please let me know if I should email 
you copies of the ship manifest and naturalization.

Hi,

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed information. I have to 
tell you I am completely blown away by learning of the breadth of the 
Langsam family.  I am fascinated by it- as I essentially lost contact 
with the Langsam family upon the death of my father when I was 5 years 
old. I am now 48. I had always been under the impression, (Iï¿½m not sure 
from where) that the Langsam family was a small one.  Indeed, the few 
Langsamï¿½s that I have come across in NYC are either not Jewish or did 
not appear to be relatives from my scant knowledge of the family. From 
your website, I now know the error of my belief.  I am quite interested 
in seeing where I fit into the family tree you have been compiling- your 
website is incredible, I am still wandering through it.  

I will provide what sketchy information that I have about my branch of 
the tree  and would love to receive the materials you mentioned that you 
have regarding Isidore's entry into the United States as well as any other 
suggestions you may have for finding more information. Isidoreï¿½s wife, my 
grandmother, Jenny predeceased Isidore and he remarried a woman that I 
knew only as "Grandma Goldie". Isidore's three sonsï¿½ families are as 
follows:  
*  Abraham (wife Sylvia) had one son Richard (me) and one daughter Bette 
   Lynne (now Bette Lynne Pricer); 
*  Solomon (the youngest son) was married to Marsha and had one son, Joel; 
*  Ralph was married to Bernice and had one son, Lawrence and one daughter, 
   Diane.  

Do you have any information regarding Isidoreï¿½s parents or into which branch 
of Pesach's family he fits? If you do, I would be very interested in securing 
such information.

Also, how does one get a copy of the ï¿½Langsam-Spiraï¿½ book you mention on your 
website?
 
Again, many thanks for providing this insight into my long lost family.

Richard Langsam

Hi,
Thanks for your kind words. I am very happy to try and place you on the 
tree. Unfortunately, there is still not enough detail to do that. Perhaps 
if you can obtain the microfilmed vital records we would uncover more 
leads and details. Is that something that you are interested in pursuing? 

Do you have any connection with the cousins that I mentioned (or didn't)? 
They may help provide more details/leads. How about the death (or marriage) 
record for Isidore? I work in NYC (near ground zero) and may be able to 
look up the marriage record at 31 Chambers. Regarding your request, I will 
email them as attachments. Can you supply a mailing address as well? 

Suzan Wynne's email is srwynne@erols.com. Let me know when you receive the
book and I will walk you through what I see as your section. 

Attached are the images I have scanned.

What other Langsam's have you met that were not Jewish? I have not met any 
that did not have Jewish roots.

Thank you for your update.  There is one minor error-
Izak's son, Ralph, was married to "Bernice", not to
Sylvia.
Best regards.
