    <h2 id="pintos-project-guide">Pintos Project Guide</h2>

    <p> The course project is based on
        <a href="http://pintos-os.org">Pintos</a>. Pintos is a teaching operating system
        for 80x86. It is simple and small (compared to Linux). On the other hand,
        it is realistic enough to help you understand core OS concepts in depth.
        It supports kernel threads, virtual memory, user programs, and file system.
        But its original implementations are premature or incomplete. Through the
        projects, you will be strengthening some of these areas of Pintos to make
        it complete.</p>

    <p>
        Since Pintos is designed
        for 80x86 architecture,
	<!--at the end of the projects, -->
        you could run theoretically
        the OS that you build on a regular IBM-compatible PC! Of course, during development,
        running Pintos on bare metal machines each time could be time consuming. Instead,
        you will run the projects in an x86 emulator, in particular, <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net">Bochs</a>
        or <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a>. Pintos has also been tested with
        <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare Player</a>.</p>

    <p> We will start with a pre-project and then do one substantial project.
        Note that in addition to the pre-project, Pintos has 4 other substantial projects.
        However, in this class, you will only do one of those substantial projects as the project is only 10% of your grade.
        Pintos projects are known to be hard. They have a reputation of taking a lot of time. But
        they are also as rewarding as they are challenging.
        Moreover, since you are only required to do one of these substantial projects (in addition to the pre-project),
	we don't anticipate the project to be very challenging.

    <h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
    <p>
        Lab 0 is an individual project. From Lab 1 and onwards, you can work in groups of
        1-3 people. We will overlap Lab 0 with the stage of forming groups. So start
        talking with your classmates around once the course begins!
    </p>

    <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
    <p>To get started, you can get a copy of the Pintos source code distribution.</p>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/trusslab/pintos.git
</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>or</p>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ardalan/courses/os/pintos.tar.gz
</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-warning">
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <strong>Warning!</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            The Pintos source code above has some customizations in it compared to the official Pintos distribution.
	    Therefore, you
            should be only getting the source code from the above channels. In other words,
            do not download from other websites.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Before you can compile and develop on Pintos, you will need to have a machine
        with the appropriate environment setup. We will be instructing you on how to set up
        the Pintos development environment on your school Openlab accounts.
	We will be test your code on these school machines. We have also included instructions for
        setting up the Pintos development environment on your own machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OS).
	You can find the instructions here: <a href="project_setup.html">project setup guide</a></p>

    <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

    <p>We will grade your assignments based on test results (<strong>60% of your grade</strong>)
        as well as design quality (<strong>40% of your grade</strong>). Note that the testing grades
        are fully automated. So please turn in working code or there is no credit.
        The <a href="grading.html">grading policy page</a> lists detailed information about how
        grading is done.</p>

    <hr size="6"/>

    <h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

    <p>We will be using EEE Dropbox for collecting the assignment submissions.
       To submit, generate a tarball of your source tree and upload in Dropbox.
       We only need the source files. Therefore, do not include the binaries.
       You can create a tarball using this command:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td class="example"><pre>$ tar -zcvf pintos.tar.gz pintos</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>


    <hr size="6"/>

    <h3 id="late-policies">Late Policies</h3>
    <p>Late submissions will receive penalties
       as follows: you lose 5% of the submission grade for every late hour.
       </p>

    <!--
    <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

    <h4 id="gdb-port">GDB Port</h4>
    <p>If you are using gdb on the lab machines to debug Pintos, you may encounter
    a port conflict error. Thatâ€™s because <code class="highlighter-rouge">pintos --gdb</code> will invoke the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-s</code> option
    with QEMU, which in turn is a short-hand for <code class="highlighter-rouge">-gdb tcp::1234</code>. So multiple users
    might try to compete for the same port. Weâ€™ve modified the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pintos</code> script
    to add two options to work around this.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">--gdb-port</code> to specify a port explicitly. You can choose any port thatâ€™s available
    to bind gdb, e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">pintos --gdb --gdb-port=2430</code>.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">--uport</code> to calculate a port number deterministically based on the user id.
    So different users on the lab machines will get a different port. Example:
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">pintos --gdb --uport</code>. You can find the generated port in the command verbose
    output (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">qemu-system-i386 ... -gdb tcp::25501</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you use these two options, you also need to change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">target remote</code> command
    in the gdb session to point to the specified/calculated port instead of 1234.</p>

    <h3 id="cheating-and-collaboration">Cheating and Collaboration</h3>
    <div class="panel panel-danger">
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <strong>Warning!</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            This class has zero tolerance for cheating. We will run tools to check your submission
            against a comprehensive database of solutions including past and present submissions
            for potential cheating. The consequences are very high. Please read UCI's <a
                href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">academic integrity information for students</a>.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The basic policies are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never share code or text on the project. <em class="text-danger">That also means do not make your solutions
            public on the Internet, e.g., GitHub public repo</em>.
        </li>
        <li>Never use someone else's code or text in your solutions.</li>
        <li>Never consult project code or text found on the Internet.</li>
        <li>You may read but not copy Linux or BSD source code. <em class="text-danger">But you must cite any code
            that inspired your code</em>. As long as you cite what you used, it's
            not cheating. In the worst case, we deduct points if it undermines
            the assignment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the other hand, we encourage collaboration in the following form:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share ideas (but do not give code to others).</li>
        <li>Explain your code to someone to see if they know why it does not work. But they're not allowed to write code for you. Just exchange ideas.</li>
        <li>Help someone else debug if they're stuck. But you're not allowed to write code for them. Just exchange ideas.</li>
    </ul>
