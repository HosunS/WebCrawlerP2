<TABLE border=10><TR><TD><font size="+2"><B>R' Yakov (Yentshi)</B></FONT>  Uri (1810- 1855), son of Pinchus Aryeh, ABD Turka, married twice. His first wife was <a href="bny-yscr.htm#L3.7">Rifka Spira</a>, daughter of R' Hersh Mylech Spira, and they had 3 known children. Rivka died in her father's lifetime. R' Yakov, remarried, to Rifka's niece <a href="bny-yscr.htm#L3.4.5">Yitta Leah</a>. She was a daughter of <a href="bny-yscr.htm#L3.4">Sara Spira</a> and Moshe Schonfeld. R' Yakov and Yitta Leah had additional children. This has led to some confusion as to which children were from his first wife and which from his second. This was further amplified because of the close family relationship between the wives.</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
