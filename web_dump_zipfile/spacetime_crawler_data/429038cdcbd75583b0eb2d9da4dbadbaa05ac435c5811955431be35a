Title: Parameterized Balanced Aspect Ratio Trees
<br>
Speaker: Amitabh Chaudhary</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
General purpose spatial data structures like the <I>k</I>-d trees and quad
trees are widely used to answer a variety of queries like range
searches, proximity queries, and nearest-neighbor queries.  They,
however, do not have good bounds on worst case performance for either
the exact or the approximate versions of these queries.  Good bounds
for the approximate versions exist if a tree has bounds on both the
depth and the aspect ratio of the regions --- the aspect ratio is
small if the region is "well rounded".  We present Parameterized
Balanced Aspect Ratio (PBAR) trees and show that they have the desired
bounds.  A PBAR tree can be constructed using any three given
partitioning vectors and form regions that are convex; they are
superior to other recently developed data structures that too have
bounds on the depth and aspect ratio.
