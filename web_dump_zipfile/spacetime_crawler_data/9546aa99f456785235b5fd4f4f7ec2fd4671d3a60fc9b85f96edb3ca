<p class="title">The procedure</p>

<p>This quarter, we're using a system we built called Checkmate, which
allows you to submit your projects via the Web. In order to use it, you
first have to activate your UCInetID if you haven't already. UCI
provides all its students with basic computing, including electronic
mail and other Internet services, via a "UCInetID" computer account.
Instructions for activating this account are available from several
sources, but perhaps the easiest way is to activate your account
on-line at <a href="http://activate.uci.edu/">activate.uci.edu</a>.
All ICS 23 students need this account, both for using Checkmate, and
also so that the course staff can email you when necessary. If you have
not activated your UCInetID, do so immediately.</p>

<p>To use Checkmate once you've activated your UCInetID, all you need to do is go to <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>,
log in using your UCInetID, and follow the instructions there. (If you
get a message about security certificates, just click "Continue.")</p>

<p>If you have any reason to believe that the system isn't working as
you believe it should, read the instructions carefully, try it a
second time, and if you're still having difficulty, send us
an email describing the problem as precisely as possible. If you keep
us informed about problems in a timely way, we will make sure that any
problems with Checkmate won't affect your grade.</p>
