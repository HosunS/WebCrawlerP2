Data Structures for Non-Manifold Topological Representations<br>
Mac Casale, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

Various data structures have been proposed for quickly traversing
the adjacency relations of complex geometric objects. The first was
probably the winged-edge data structure proposed by Baumgart in
1972, which was able to effectively represent complex topological
polyhedra. This data structure has been implemented in many
applications, including CAD, Computer Vision, etc. In this talk we
present some extensions to the winged-edge representation that
allow more complex objects to be represented, e.g., polyhedra with
cracks, multiple regions, etc. Such objects are often referred to
as "non-manifold" for reasons presented in the talk. Various
extensions are considered and their grounding in applications are
highlighted.
