Dear Moishe,
                  It's not that I haven't done any research on the Langsam 
family, but to tell you the truth,  About 15 years ago a woman with the last 
name of Cohen was also doing reasearch on the Langsam-Spira family.  I gave 
her my information of which there is very little because of the fact that my 
father-in-law was the only survivor of his family during the Holocaust.  He 
lived in a small village in Poland and he has been deceased for 21 years.  
What little information we do have we have gotten from my mother-in-law and 
that is pretty sketchy.  She knew that there were 2 uncles living in New 
York.  By the time they emigrated to the U.S. they were elderly.  Their 
children wanted nothing to do with these foreign cousins so all contact broke 
off.  This family tree that was put together in the eighties could find no 
connection with our branch of the Langsams.
           I'm really sorry that I could not be of more help.
                                                             Sincerely,
                                                Marsha Langsam

Dear Moishe,
           I located the book that was compiled by Michael Cohen.  Here is 
the information I have:
           My father-in-law's father, Louser had a brother (possibly more 
than one) that came to the states (New York) in the early part of the 1900's. 
 From the ship records that Michael Cohen discovered, there were 4 brothers 
that came from Jurezkowa Poland.  They could very well be my father-in-law's 
uncles.  Their names were Abraham, Hersh, Meyer, and Shajie.  Their parents 
were listed as Jacob Langsam and Leie Kabalnick.  Supposedly, Leie Kabalnick 
had a brother Elias in New York. Abraham came first and went to an uncle M. 
Goldblatt in NYC.  He worked as a waiter at the Hotel Cecil in 1910 and lived 
at 30 w. 118th Street.
              Louser stayed in Poland because his parents were there and 
raised his children, my father-in-law being the oldest, did not leave at the 
onset of the war as he had to take care of the farm.
               My father-in-law had 3 brothers and 1 sister. Israel, Moishe, 
Aaron and Rachel.
                This is as far back as I can go since I was really lucky just 
to find out the names of my father-in-law's siblings.  No one bothered to ask 
their names for future baby namings.  I asked quite by accident while 
visiting him in the hospital shortly before he passed away.
                   We never pursued the contact of the relatives in New York 
and no one ever contacted us.
                I hope this can help in some way.  If you find any relatives 
it would be nice because my husband has no one from his father's family.
                                              Sincerely,
                                        Marsha

Dear Moishe,
           As I was perusing your website, I came across the log of social 
security numbers with births and deaths.  One stood out.  I mentioned to you 
that my father-in-law went to visit an Uncle Harry who lived in NY.  From the 
Langsam-Spira book (of which I have a copy)  The four brothers that came from 
my father-in-laws home town  were probably his uncles.  The only one with a 
social security number is Harry.  His birth date matches.  The other three 
could possibly changed their names, as was the custom at that time, to sound 
more American.  The name and zip code that I pulled up are Harry Langsam Born 
1892, died May 1967  and the zip 11230 Brooklyn Kings NY.  Has anyone laid 
claim to that branch?  The children of that Harry would be  close to 80 or 
85. My father-in-law's father probably was the eldest.  It would be 
interesting to finally meet some relatives from my father-in-laws side.  I 
know my husband, Saul and my sister-in-law Nina would be thrilled.
          I guess I should tell you, I have 3 boys.  My eldest is 21 
(Jeffrey) my middle is 19 (Andrew) and my youngest is 14(David)
 Funny how some of the same names keep cropping up.
       If I can be of any more help or if you come across anything else, 
please let me know.

Dear Moishe,
                   The information in the book by Susan Wynne is more than I 
was able to find out.  The only reason I would like information about our 
family, is that someone may possibly have pictures that were sent prior to 
WW2.  No one from that branch of the family ever responded to Susan's 
inquiries.  Sorry I can't be of more help.

Subject: Langsam letter

Dear Marsha: I attach a circa 1938 letter which I believe proves that
we are cousins. The attached letter was written to Sam (Shaje) Langsam
when he lived with my grandfather Harry (Hersh or Herse) on 23rd street
(with my mother Emily and Uncle Bill--who is cc'd on this email). Of
the 4 brothers, Meyer, Abraham, Hersh and Shaje, Sam/Shaje either never
married or was a widower--and lived with Harry (Hersh/Herse)in the
1930's on 23rd street in Brooklyn. Meyer/Mendel died in the flu
pandemic of 1917. I don't know anything about Abe--perhaps Uncle Bill
could tell us. In any event, the attached letter was given to me in
1978 by my mother when I was trying to figure out where the family came
from. My mother did not know who the letter was from, except that it
was from family in Poland. She said that Uncle used to send packages to
the family. Well, I tried to have the letter translated by a co-worker
who was a Holocaust survivor in 1978--he started to cry when he read the
letter--he said the letter was way too sad. I prevailed upon him to at
least tell me who the letter was from. (He did tell me that it was
actually two letters). He wrote on the attachment that the letter was
from: Her. Luser Langsam, Juriczkowa, Post Woitkowa, POW. Dobromil,
Poland. Of course, my mother had no idea who Luser Langsam was--she
thought he was a cousin. In reality, Luser Langsam was the 5th brother
who stayed behind in Poland. I believe Luser is your grandfather, Uncle
Bill's uncle, and Richard and mine, great uncle. I have no idea what
the rest of the letter says. Please see what you can do to have the
letter translated (and let's share the info of course)--I am also trying
from my end. Thanks! 

Shabbat Shalom and Hag Sameach!

Jeff, this is pretty cool stuff!

Now, the big question is how to trace the lineage from Jacob Langsam to
the original Langsam (Pesach). We may need to enlist the help of Moishe
Miller, who developed the website on the Langsam lineage (I'm cc'ing him
with the only email address I have for him).

Moishe, if you get this, please respond so that we know your email is
active.

Thanks!

Moishe: Shavua Tov! I can fill-in some of the blanks. Meyer/Mendel
Langsam died in the flu pandemic of 1917. Shaje/Sam Langsam died in the
late 30's or early 40's in Brooklyn--as far as I know, he had no
children. I know nothing about Abe. Harry/Herse/Hersh Langsam is/was
my grandfather. He died in 1967, leaving my mother, Emily Fine, and her
brother, Bill Langson. Seymour, my father, (died 1980) and Emily Fine
had 3 sons. Mitchell, the oldest, who has 2 daughters. Richard, the
youngest is married to Laura. Pam and I have 3 sons, Samuel, Benjamin
and David. And, here is the letter I sent to Marsha the other day.

Hi,

Just a quick check at my records. In the 1930 census, in
the Bronx, there was an Abraham Langsam, age 39, from
Galicia, married to Frieda, age 34, with children:
Caroline age 14 (c. 1916)
Miriam age 12 (c. 1918)
Milton age 8 (c. 1922)
Edith Frances age 6 months (c. 1929)

I also found a death record for a MILTON LANGSAM, born 25
Dec 1921 and passed away on 7 Mar 1995 in 33321 (Fort
Lauderdale, FL). You can file a request with Social
Security to find out more details, possibly even forward a
letter to the next of kin.

On Switchboard.com I find no LANGSAMs listed for Fort
Lauderdale, but there are 17 in the state of Florida. You
might try calling a few.

Let me know how else I can help.
Moishe

Dear Moishe,
  This is truly a wonderful event that has happened to our family.  
  After 60 years my husband Saul and his sister, Nina, have found 
  cousins on their father's side.  I do have an update on some of 
  our information.  Saul and I  moved in 1990 and now reside in Elkins 
  Park.  Our children are Jeffrey,26, who got married in 2004 to Stacey.  
  Andrew is now 24, and we have a third son, David who is 20. My sister-
  in-law, Nina and her husband Steve have a daughter Lisa,29, married 
  to Dan and their son Harris is married to Marla.  They have also 
  become grandparents to a beautiful baby girl named Abbie.  Nina and 
  Steve reside in Cherry Hill NJ.

Thanks again for your wonderful work
 Regards,
   Marsha Langsam

Hi,

Below is the tree as I have it put together so far. I
muddled my way through one letter. BTW, the handwriting
looks different and I am not sure if they were written by
the same person. Anyhow, one letter is from Moshe and it
begins with "My dear brother-in-law", so I am guessing that
this one was written by Moshe Billet, brother to Harry's
(Hersh) wife. I have copies of the ship manifests and will
review. I think there may be a BILLET reference. 

The most important question for you tho think about: Do you
know of ANY other LANGSAMs that are cousins to you, even if
you do not know how?

Moishe, this is great. I've got a few insights.

First, our grandfather Harry's (Hersh's) wife was Hattie Wolf (i.e., was
not a Billet). However, on the Ellis Island ship manifest record for
Abe Langsam, there is a mention of a friend David Billet on Willer (sp?)
Street who came to pick him up. Is it possible that one of the sisters
who remained in Jurezkowa was married to a Billet?

Incidentally, I had some difficulty finding Abe's record. It's actually
listed in ellisisland.org as Abraham Langsaw (and not Langsam). He came
over in December 1905 and was listed as age 17 at the time, making his
birth year 1888. 

By the way, who was Jacob Langsam's father?

Moishe,
 Is it possible that Moishe Billet was a brother to Necha and writing the 
 letter for her?  I don't know any background on my father-in-law's mother.  
 Was that her maiden name?  Was she asking for a dowry for her daughter 
 Rachel? There are still many questions and I'm hoping when I have the l
 etter translated it will answer some of them.  We're still working on it.

Dear Moishe,
My mother-in-law is translating the letter.  She is having some 
difficulty because it is not printed yiddish but written.  If the 
letter was signed by Moishe, He could have written it for his mother.  
Moishe was a sibling of my father-in-law, hence my dearest brother-
in-law.  I do not know of any sisters of the Langsam brothers from 
Jureczkowa. As far as any other survivors from this line, if they 
did not come to the states, they perished in the holocaust.  I do 
know that Luser passed away prior to the holocaust from disease 
and my father-in-law stayed in Poland to look after his mother and 
siblings as he was the oldest.

The baby Abbie is the child of Lisa and Dan, and yes, Nina's married 
name is Jay

If you have any other questions I hope that I can help
                                                          Marsha

Dear Moishe,
 I had a lovely conversation with Emily Fine last night.  She gave me a 
 little more information.  Sha remembers that her Uncle Abe, Harry's 
 brother was married to Sadie.  They had 2 children Harold and Caroline.  
 She was friends with Caroline and she thinks that she married a man 
 named Bob Schwartz.  Also her father had a cousin also named Abe Langsam 
 who was married to Molly and they had 2 sons, Jack and Milton.
                   We're  trying!

that had lived with us was not Sam Langsam but Sam Wolf who was my
mothers uncle.You can check this out with your mother who will i am sure
will remember. My farther had a cousin in the bronx who name was Abe
langsam and his wife was Molly Langsam. His brother who also lived in
the Bronx was also Abe Langsam had 2 children Caroline & Harold. Abe had
lost one leg due to diabetes and my farther would help them as much has
he could.We have lost contact with them after my farther died but i
remember them at my wedding. The Milton mentioned in Florida i believe
was my farthers cousin son Abe langsam. Sam Langsam I believe was never
married. My farther had a cousin that wound up in Sweden that he helped
come to the U.S. He was in Pensylvania the last i remember. If you need
any further information please keep me in the loop 

Uncle Bill

Subject: RE: langsam family history

Dear Uncle Bill: Thanks for your email-- Mom also had a lot of
information. I wanted to summarize everything for you, Richard and
Mitchell--and our cousins Saul and Marsha--who are cc'd on this email.
Mom had a terrific conversation with Marsha and I had a wonderful talk
with Saul. Here goes:

Bottom-line--we reconnected with the Langsam family--here are the
details (this is a combination of what Richard and I learned from Mom,
public records, Saul and Marsha Langsam, my own recollection, and you):

1. Grandpa (Pop) Harry was one of five brothers--Abraham/Abe,
Meyer/Mendel, Shaje/Sam, Herse/Hersh/Harry and Louser (pronounced
loo-ser). They were the children of Yacov and Leia (Kabalnik) Langsam,
from the village of Jaretskowa/Jaricskowa in Galicia. Yacov's mother
had a farm and was better off than most--but Yacov, although very poor,
apparently never asked for help from his mother. Mom says that Pop once
told her that there were 4 sisters as well--but no one else knows of
that. They barely had enough to eat.

2. Abe was the first one to come to America. He saved money and sent
for Grandpa/Pop. Then Grandpa saved money and sent for Meyer/Mendel and
then he also sent money to bring over Sam. Why Louser did not come over
we don't know. But I speculate he had some health problem and therefore
could not travel--but we don't know. The brothers left to avoid being
conscripted into the army.

3. Sam never married--and he lived by himself in the Bronx--I think.
Meyer/Mendel died in the flu pandemic of 1917.

4. Louser was married to Necha, stayed in Poland with Yacov. Grandma
Leia, whose Hebrew name was probably Leia Kreindel-- died young--Mom
believes that Grandpa Yacov may have actually lived until he was killed
by the Nazis. The only thing I have found so far from them is the letter
from 1938 which is being translated.

5. Louser died before the war from some illness. He had children: Tzvi
Mordechai Langsam (survived), Israel Langsam - 1942; Moishe Langsam
- 1942; Rachel Langsam - 1942; Aaron Langsam - 1942. Saul's father
(Tzvi Mordecai?), was the only one to survive the war--from Dachau. I
believe everyone else died in Auschwitz--but I don't know for sure. He
was sent to Sweden to a DP camp after the war, where he married Dora.
He is the nephew who made contact with Grandpa. Mom distinctly
remembers sending packages to them in Sweden. Grandpa was not certain
at first who exactly he was--but, he told Mom that this was a person in
need and they must help--even if he wasn't a relative. Eventually,
Grandpa helped to bring them over to Philadelphia. Saul remembers
visiting Grandpa in an apartment. Mom believes they came to your
wedding--do you have wedding pictures you could scan and send? Saul's
father was your and Mom's first cousin.

6. The brother Abe you mention below was married to Sadie. His child
Harold died young. Caroline Langsam married Bob? Schwartz--Mom doesn't
think she has an address--but we are working on that.

7. The other cousins--Abe and Molly Langsam--Mom believes that part of
the family is from Romania--not far from Juretskowa--we are checking on
that. 

8. Uncle Bill--you could help if you have any addresses, phone numbers
of any of the Langsams, old letters, photos, or anything else you can
remember.

Finally, I think it is very appropriate that this week--on Yom
Hashoah--we are reconnecting--and remembering those of our family who
died in the Holocaust. 

Regards to all! 


Jeff

Jeff, thanks for summarizing all of this. It's pretty amazing stuff. I
will work on getting copies/photos of the ship manifests from Ellis
Island.

Also, thanks to Moishe Miller for everything he's done to document the
Langsam family history over the years, and for creating the forum that
allowed us to find Saul and Marsha (albeit through a five-year old web
posting!).

Moishe, would you happen to know how many Langsam descendents there are
in the US?

Thanks!

Rich

Dear Cousins,

I have reviewed your notes and believe that the OTHER Abe
Langsam is the one from Przemysl, Poland, mentioned as the
H23 link in the LANGSAM-SPIRA book. Some detail on this
family is in my website. The exact page is:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/h23.htm

Notice the name BILLET as Mollie's surname. 

The latest information I have for this tree is:
1 H23 - unknown LANGSAM 
........ 2 Leah Langsam 
............ +Leibush Lustig 
................... 3 Ephraim Lustig 
................... 3 child Lustig 
................... 3 child Lustig 
................... 3 child Lustig 
................... 3 David Lustig 
............................. 4 Renee Lustig 
................................. +boy Aranoff 
........ 2 child Langsam 
................... 3 Abraham Langsam 1888 - 1961 of
Przemysl, Poland
....................... +Mollie Billet 
............................. 4 Jack Langsam 1911 - 1971 
................................. +Dorothy ? 
........................................ 5 William

............................................ +Linda ? 
............................. *2nd Wife of Jack Langsam: 
................................. +Judith ? 
........................................ 5 Andrew

............................. 4 Milton Langsam 


I know that in 1985 William Langsam was in Insurance and
lived in Long Island. Looking in switchboard, I find only
one William Langsam in all of NY. He is in Long Island, at
38 Stone Hill Dr S 
Manhasset, NY 11030-4426
(516) 365-4343 

If you follow-up with him, please let me know what happens.
I called him several times a few years ago, but we never
actually spoke.

I also have a question. You state that "Louser died before
the war from some illness", while the Langsam-Spira book
states that he perished in the Holocaust. Can this be
clarified any further?

Regarding Rich's comments, first let me once again thank
him for his very kind words. As for the Langsam manifests
from Ellis Island, I have most of them. Let me know which
ones you would like and if I can email large files to you
and I will send them.

As for the number of living Langsam descendents, I do not
have a current count. What I can tell you is that Pesach
Langsam, our earliest known ancestor, has over 14,000 known
descendents. I am still computerizing the families, but
already have data-entered over 11,600 people. This spans
eleven generations. 

Can you identify all the new email addresses on this note?

-Moishe

You might also want to search the Hamburg departure lists,
