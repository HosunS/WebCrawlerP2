<H1>Independent Study Opportunities</H1>
<H4>Winter and Spring 1998 --- David G. Kay</H4>
<P>I have a broad range of projects for students to work on independently.
For each, there is some flexibility on the number of units and the
precise form your participation can take.</P>
<P>Many of these involve Java and the Web,
so if you're interested in 
developing or honing those
skills, here are some chances.
For more information, please
<A href="mailto:kay@uci.edu">get in touch with me</A>.</P>
<p>ICS is currently considering some changes to the first-year courses,
including the use of Java and Windows NT machines.  Once these changes
become official, opportunities for projects will include developing
new courseware and lab assignments, porting existing code, evaluating
new support software, and more.  Stay tuned to this page for further 
details.<p>
<hr>
<H2>Automatic Assistance for Evaluating Student Programming Assignments</H2>
<P>It's hard (perhaps impossible) for a human being to read a computer 
program of any size and know how well it works, yet instructors of courses 
that require programming assignments must perform this task 
routinely.</p><p>  
Some tools exist to assist in this and similar tasks, for example by 
running each student's program against a suite of test cases and collecting 
the results or by comparing students' programs to detect possible 
plagiarism.  Participants in this project will investigate existing tools, 
design new tools, and port or implement them in the ICS environment,
perhaps using Java.  (Some work has
already been done on this project, but students are 
needed to carry it on.)
</P>
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
[If you know some of these already, that's good; if not, you
may have the opportunity to learn them.]
Java, Web forms design and scripting, various network programming skills.

<H4>Requirements</H4>
Upper division standing, 3.0 GPA, interest in and aptitude for 
system-building (and pedagogical administration)

<H2>Hashing Visualization</H2>
It would be nice to see how evenly a hash function distributes
keys throughout a hash table.
This project involves developing a program, probably as a Java
applet, that allows its user to specify a file of keys and a
hash function and presents a clear graphic representation of 
where those keys end up in the hash table.  (Of course there
are issues of table size and collision resolution schemes that
might be hard-coded at first and parameterized later on.)
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
Hashing, Java

<H4>Requirements</H4>
3.0 GPA and a good sense for visually clear and appealing displays.

<H2>TeX to HTML Conversion</H2>
This project involves converting a large base of text
in the TeX typesetting language to HTML for Web publication.
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
[If you know some of these already, that's good; if not, you
may have the opportunity to learn them.]
TeX, HTML, large Web site design and organization, 
scripting or other automated tools for document 
conversion

<H4>Requirements</H4>
3.0 GPA, excellent organizational skills and attention to detail


<H2>Security and Privacy on the Internet</H2>
Most people use the Internet as if nobody's watching.
They may read news groups dealing with private problems
(such as socially stigmatized diseases); they may
download sexually suggestive information; they may
visit sites run by non-mainstream political groups;
they may send personal Email to their friends or family.
The typical user, sitting alone at his or her computer,
probably thinks this information is private.
<p>
But there's no guarantee of that.
Does the service provider promise to keep the information confidential?
Even if so, would its employees turn down $10,000 from the 
<em>National Enquirer</em> for a peek at the supposedly confidential 
records?
Even many technically savvy users may not be aware
of copies and traces left by a user's internet activities
in newsrc files, caches, system backups, or 
statistics gathered about net traffic.
<p>
Public figures or government officials certainly 
should be concerned about these issues, but "normal"
people too might be the subject of queries from prospective
employers or even social acquaintances.
<p>
The task here is to develop a guide for computer users,
detailing the potential privacy pitfalls and recommending
steps to take to protect one's privacy on the net. 
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
Operational details of network software, including news,
Email, and Web browsers; backup policies and strategies
<H4>Requirements</H4>
Upper division standing, 3.0 GPA, 
something of a secret agent or hacker's mentality---an ability
to ferret out traces of system activity


<H2>Other Projects</H2>
I am always interested in hearing other ideas for projects.

<!-- PREVIOUS QUARTERS' PROJECTS

<H2>Pedagogical Software Evaluation</H2>
The ICS Department offers a series of courses, such as ICS 
1A, 1P, and
1B, that involve Macintosh computer lab use for purposes other than
writing programs.
We have identified a variety of software that may help further the
goals of these courses.  
The task involved here is to evaluate this
software to see if it's appropriate for the audience, 
and if so to propose possible exercises or activities with the
software. 
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
Symbolic logic, decision-making and decision theory, probability

<H4>Requirements</H4>
Upper division standing, 3.0 GPA, 
interest in and aptitude for good pedagogy---what makes a
learning activity enjoyable and effective

<H2>Redesign of Introductory Labs</H2>
The first-year courses in ICS (21, 22, 23) are being 
offered in C++ starting this year.
This will require a redesign of the course materials
and lab assignments---not just a straight translation 
from Pascal, but some careful consideration of how best 
to convey the first-year concepts using a different 
programming language.
The task involved here is to work with me and other 
faculty to review the
first-year course materials, rewrite them as necessary
and appropriate, and test them using the Metrowerks 
Code Warrior environment.
In particular, one person is needed to re-code the
calculator interface from Pascal into C++.
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
C++ programming, object-oriented design 

<H4>Requirements</H4>
Upper division standing, 3.0 GPA, knowledge of C++ and 
OOP, good writing skills,
interest in and aptitude for good pedagogy---what makes a
learning activity enjoyable and effective


<H2>Analysis and Categorization of Search Engines</H2>

<P>A wide variety of search engines and search services exists
on the World-Wide Web.  Various books and articles have
compared and contrasted these services, but most are 
superficial and don't answer the deeper questions that 
someone with computing experience to see at a glance what material is available
from each service (whole text, titles and URLs, selected sites,
the whole Web) and what kind of searching the service allows
(keywords, fully nested boolean expressions, English queries).
</P>

<P>The task here is to produce a terse but complete guide to
the search services available on the Web, ideally something that
could be printed on a one-page reference sheet.
When this project was originally posted, local Web 
experts said nothing of the sort existed.  Now there 
are at least two 
(<A HREF="http://www.stark.k12.oh.us/Docs/search/">http://www.stark.k12.oh.us/Docs/search/</A>
and 
<A HREF="http://info.anu.edu.au/courses/intro/wkbk/bg.html">
http://info.anu.edu.au/courses/intro/wkbk/bg.html</A>) in addition
to a local page that's the work of Charles Yi:
<a href="yi.search.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/yi.search.html</a>.
Someone working further on this project could update this page for new
search engines, add some instructive examples of queries each engine
supports, or revise the tables to reflect the syntax supported by
each engine to accomplish a given query task.
</P>
<H4>Concepts involved</H4>
[If you know some of these already, that's good; if not, you
may have the opportunity to learn them.]
Web navigation, search strategies

<H4>Requirements</H4>
Upper division standing, 3.0 GPA, familiarity with boolean logic,
excellent organizational skills
