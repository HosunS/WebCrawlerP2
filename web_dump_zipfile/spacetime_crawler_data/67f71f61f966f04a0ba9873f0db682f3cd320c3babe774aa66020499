== Course Overview ==
This two-course sequence is intended to be the "grand finale" for Data Science majors.
Its goal is to tie together many of the topics that are independently covered in the first 3+ years of Data Science requirements and electives; it also aims to fill in in some of the potential gaps required to solve an end-to-end problem. 
In addition to a brief review of some of the required skills, the course will cover problem definition and analysis, data representation, algorithm selection, solution validation, and results presentation.
Students will do projects, possibly in small teams, while the lecture periods will cover analysis alternatives, project planning, and data analysis issues.
The first quarter will emphasize tools and techniques, approach selection, project planning, and experimental design.
The second quarter will focus on project execution, data analysis, and presentation of results.
Project planning and execution will include the setting of weekly or bi-weekly milestones as well as weekly progress tracking and reporting.
The final course deliverables will include both a written project report and an oral presentation of the project results.

== Prerequisites ==
Senior standing and completion of the following courses: STATS 68, STATS 111, IN4MATX 43, COMPSCI 122A, COMPSCI 161, and COMPSCI 178.

== Assignments, Projects, and Grading ==

=== Grading Criteria (for 170A) ===
Homework: 40% [[BR]]
Project proposal: 50% [[BR]]
Class participation: 10% [[BR]]
[[BR]]
Late homeworks will not be graded - please submit whatever you have completed by the homework deadline.  Each homework's due date is listed in the table of homework assignments at the end of this page, and each homework will be due in EEE by 11:45 PM on the indicated date.

A single grade will be assigned at the end of Spring quarter for this class, with 50% weight on the Winter grade and 50% on the Spring grade.

=== Homework and Class Participation ===
The first quarter will involve a mix of lectures and homework assignments intended to dust off, sharpen, or introduce the skills, tools, and techniques that you will need to successfully execute your course project. Since you are now seniors, and this is your Data Science grand finale, individual initiative and engagement will be expected of all students. The homework assignments may be "looser" than what you are used to -- you will have to seek out some of the information needed to complete the assignments and to make  choices about how to attack some of the challenges -- i.e., spoon feeding will be kept to a minimum. The lectures will aim for interactivity, and class participation will be encouraged (and in fact expected).

=== Academic Honesty Policy ===
Students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!

----
== Software Platform(s) ==
This course will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, various Python packages/tools for data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, and open source databases (PostgreSQL).  For convenience and package completeness, students are advised to download the most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and friends (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the most recent EDB distribution of PostgreSQL (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
