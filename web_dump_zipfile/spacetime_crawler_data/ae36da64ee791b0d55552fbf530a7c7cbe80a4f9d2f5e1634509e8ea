<h2>6 June 1997:<br>
LRU is Better than FIFO<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jnoga/">John Noga</a>, Computer

<p>In the paging problem we have to manage a two-level memory
system, in which the first level has short access time but can hold
only up to <i>k</i> pages, while the second level is very large but
slow. We use competitive analysis to study the relative performance
of two best known algorithms for paging, LRU and FIFO. Sleator and
Tarjan proved that the competitive ratio of LRU and FIFO is <i>
k</i>. In practice, however, LRU is known to perform much better
than FIFO. It is believed that the superiority of LRU can be
attributed to locality of reference exhibited in request sequences.
In order to study this phenomenon, Borodin, Irani, Raghavan and
Schieber refined the competitive approach by introducing the
concept of access graphs. They conjectured that the competitive
ratio of LRU on each access graph is less than or equal to the
competitive ratio of FIFO. We will prove this conjecture.</p>
