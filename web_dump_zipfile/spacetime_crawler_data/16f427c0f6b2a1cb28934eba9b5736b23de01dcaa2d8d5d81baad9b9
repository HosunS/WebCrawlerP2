<p>It takes many different resources to teach CS122B. The major limitation on enrollment this quarter is course staffing&#150;there are only so many projects we can grade and demos we can attend. Right now the class is full, in that we just have the resources to cover current enrollment. I&#146;ll add students to the class if additional space opens up, such as made by students dropping the course.</p>

<p>We discuss below how to get in to CS122B, stay in, make changes, and get out; follow the directions here to minimize your hassles.</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3> To add the course</h3>
</div>

<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:cs122b-help@ics.uci.edu">cs122b-help@ics.uci.edu</a> that contains your full name, UCI student ID number (or a statement that you are an Access student), UCInetID, major, year in school (e.g. junior, senior), an affirmation that you have the completed the prerequisite for the course, and why, in a sentence or two, you need to get into CS122B this quarter. You must send the email no later than April 1, 7 pm, to ensure your request is considered.

<p>I will add folks on the basis of need&#151;those with the most urgent need to have this course this quarter have first priority. All requests sent by April 1, 7 pm will be considered before requests received after that time. I may be able to add no one, or only a few people; it depends upon how many spaces open up.</p> 

<p>At the April 2 lecture, I&#146;ll show a list of who are allowed to add; if you see the last 4 digits of your ID, bring me, by April 9, 4:30 pm, an add card for signature. If more space opens up after April 2, but prior to or on April 9, I will add in more students (if there are folks still waiting to add). No adds will be made after April 9.</p>

<p>While waiting to add, you need to keep up with the lectures and coursework, attend any project demonstrations, and meet any due dates.</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3> To change your grading status</h3>
</div>

<p>...to pass/not pass or back again: Obtain the instructor&#146;s signature on a change card.
</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3>To drop the course</h3>
</div>
	
<p>Through May 7, just have me or the TA sign a drop card. Please turn the drop card in to the Registrar's Office promptly, and no later than May 8, 5 pm (or it will not be processed). If you are going to drop, we request you do so early on, so as to minimize hassles for your partner and to make room in the class for those waiting to add.</p>

<p>If you wish to drop the course after May 8, you must see me and obtain my signature on a drop card; be prepared to give solid reasons why you must drop the course. Note that after May 8 (&#147;Friday of the sixth week&#148;), in accordance with Bren School policy, you will receive permission to drop the course only if you must do so because of major circumstances beyond your control; doing poorly in the course is not a sufficient reason. And you will also need to obtain a Dean's signature, which is also only given when major circumstances beyond your control prevent you from completing the course.</p>
