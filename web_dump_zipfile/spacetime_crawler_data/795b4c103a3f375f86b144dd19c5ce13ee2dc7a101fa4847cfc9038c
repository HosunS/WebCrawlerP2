Hello.  My name is Jessica Langsam Chisholm and I am doing some research on
my family tree.  I came across your website during my search and was hoping
you could give me some additional information.  Do you have anything on the
following names?
    Max Langsam (my grandfather)
    Jacob Langsam (my great grandfather)
    Jacob's first wife
    Jacob's parents
I know that Max and Jacob lived in New York during the 1900's.  Max (my
grandfather) died in 1987.
If you have any information, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  I do not have
a email account, but you can email a friend of mine at:  techspec@ea.net 
and she will forward the information to me.
Thanks so much!
Jessica Langsam Chisholm

Moishe-
Jessica Chisholm does not have an email account, nor does she have a
computer.  She is a friend of mine, and her husband teaches at the same
school as me.   Therefore, I helped her with her online research and allowed
her to use my email account for communicating with you.  I can relay any
information you get to her, and I will send her information back to you.
Thanks for your help!

Here is my amended family History
My grandparents were Hersch and Ruchel Langsam from Blazowa.
My father, Aaron, their son, was able to get on an illegal ship from
Danzig to Palestine in the year 1940 with about 1300 others.  The boat was
detained in Yugoslavia for reasons unknown to me and after the Nazis occupied
Jugoslavia all the 1300 persons were put in a concentration camp in Kladova ,
Jugoslavia. In October 1941 they were transferred to a camp in Sabac
Jugoslavia and all were murdered  there by the Nazis
After the war,the bodies were exhumed from their mass grave in Sabac,
Yugoslavia. and reburied in a Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.
My  mother, Esther and her two sons waited in Danzig for opportunities to
flee. We left with 500 others, the last to successfully leave, on a train to
Bratislava and from here continued on an illegal aliyah ship. After 3 month
of  hardship on the boat where 1800 people were herded into a 500 ton
freighter we arrived in Haifa. We were brought to a camp in Athlit and
detained by the British Mandate Police. Here my brother Herman died of typhoid
at the age of 3
My Mother Esther and myself (Oscar) were exiled to Mauritius until August
1945. Esther remarried but had no more children.
 As for myself:  Oscar Langsam married Helga Hadassa Goldrosen in 1954. we
live now in Rehovot , Israel, have a son Nachum , a daughter Racheli and 6
grandchildren.
Attached my family tree and a picture of the family
sincerely your's , Oscar Langsam ,       Israel

I saw your tree posted on the Ancestry.com site (via their search

Hi Moishe,


Indeed, I have spoken to David Langsam in the past. His father, I believe, comes
from the same town in Poland that my grandfather came from. David's father is
named Mark.


My father is Max Langsam and his father was Joseph Langsam.
I have mentioned your web site to my father, who would know more than I where our
family fits. I will let you know his e-mail address in another correspondence.

Moishe,  i was trying to forward a very long missive from Jehoshua 
"Oscar" Langsam who seems to live in Israel.  He had an interesting take 
on Pesach.  His family lore has it that Pesach is a direct descendant of 
Issachar, son of Jacob.  Though he states that his family is connected 
to Pesach Langsam, he does not say how. What he does know is that his 
grandparents were Hersch and Ruchel Langsam from Blazowa.
     
His father, Aaron, their son, was able to get on an illegal ship from 
Danzig to Palestine with about 1300 others.  The boat was captured and 
detained in Yugoslavia and all were shot by the Nazis.  After the war, 
the bodies were exhumed from their mass grave in Sabac, Yugo. and 
reburied in a Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.
     
His mother, Esther and her two sons waited in Danzig for opportunities 
to flee.  They left with 500 others, the last to successfully leave, on 
a train to Bratislava where they picked up a series of boats.  After 3 
months they arrived in Haifa.  They were detained.  The 3 year boy died 
of typhoid.  Esther and Oscar were exiled to Mauritius until August 
1945.  Esther remarried and had two more children. 
     
Oscar sent a tree but I couldn't read it.  I've asked him to mail it to 
me since we've had such difficulty communicating.
     
I've asked him if he knows more about how his grandfather might have 
been connected to Pesach Langsam's children. As far as I know, his 
family is not in the book. 
     
Suzan
     

Oscar's address is

Dear Oscar, 

Please see line #11 and tell me with if this record for Hersch Langsam 
of Blazow with wife Rachel still there are your grandparents? I know, 
the two attachments are huge. 
Can you tell me when your grandparents were born, etc? Hersch's father?

What ever happened to your genealogy page on the web?

Dear Moishe
Yes - Hersch Langsam and Rachel Langsam  are my grandparents. I do not know their 
birth dates. I am the son of their son Aharon Langsam born August 20th 1902 in 
Blazova and killed by the Nazis in Zacavica, Jugoslavia in October 1941.
I also know that Hersch Langsam returned to Blazova from the US and was killed by 
the Nazis in the holocaust.
I do not have a genealogy page on the web.
You are doing a great work with the family tree, thank you 
Oscar Langsam

Oscar has a changing site and this is the <a href="oscrsite.htm">link</a> to the basic information he has posted as I downloaded it. Forgive me, but the images do not load. I did not copy them.
