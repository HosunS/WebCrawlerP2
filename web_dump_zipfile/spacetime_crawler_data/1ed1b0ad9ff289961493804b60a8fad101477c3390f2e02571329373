Dear Moishe,


I came across Suzan Wynne through another branch of family. Regarding other
Langsams in Israel, interestingly enough the head of Yad Vashem, Avner
Shalev, is really a Langsam. You will note that Shalev is the Hebraicized
translation of the name Langsam. I don't think, however, that he is into
the family tree thing.


Best regards,


Dov Rubin

Good morning,
As promised, I talked to Avner Shalev about your web site. He is very
interested in your work, but says that due to his heavy workload at Yad
Vashem, he neglected dealing with his own family history. He will do his
best to find some time to answer you in detail. Meanwhile he wishes you all
the best and congratulates you on the work you have done so far. 
Best regards,

Dear Director, 

Thank you for your warm words and kind support. Perhaps you can
assist me in a somewhat selfish request. Dr. Avner Shalav is a
LANGSAM descendant, that was his family name. I have contacted 
him and his secretary (Irena Steinfeldt) countless times, but can
not seem to get any information. Does Dr. Shalav have any siblings
or relatives I can speak to instead? I do not need to find this out
from him. Like Yad >Vashem, I have the desire to perpetuate my
family, especially those that perished in the Holocaust. I can not
understand why someone in his position would not share a similar
attitude. As someone devoted to commemorating our heritage, perhaps
you can prevail upon him to answer three short questions: 
  * father's name 
  * his grandfather's name 
  * what city his grandfather was from  

Thanks again, 
Moishe Miller

Zipi,

Thank you for your inquiry and sorry for the delay in responding.

Exactly how are you related to Avner?
Father: Dov Langsam - born 1904 Grandfather: Zalman Langsam - wife: Faiga Grandfather 
born in Kanczuga and moved to Przeworsk.
What are the family names of your mother's father, Jacob (Yenkele) and his father name 
was Aizik?
Is it Langsam?

Zipi,

Thank you for your inquiry I am following up on my email below.

Exactly how are you related to Avner? Was your grandfather, Jacob, a BROTHER to 
Avner's grandfather, Zalman? Meaning both Jacob and Zalman were children of Aizik?

When/where was your Jacob born? When/where was your Aizik born? Do you know of any 
other children for Aizik? And what about Aizik's parents? Or, do you know of any 
other second (or third) cousins?

Hi,

Avner Shalev (Langsam) and me are second cousins.

My mother Yafa (scheindle/Sala) was a first cousin to Avner father Dov (Beiresh)Langsam.

My grandfather is Yakov(Yenkekle) Langsam. He was Zalman Langsam brother.

His first wife Zipora(Feige)she was my grandmother.I think she was born in Lancut . 
her family name was Landau. She died when my mother was 2 years old..

My mother, Yafa, was born in 1907 in Pprzeworsk Poland.

Yakov Langsam was married again to Sima Felner. They lived in Dembow Poland.

When my mother ,Yafa, was 12 , she was sent to live in Germany. 

In the end of 1933 she left Germany and came to Israel in January 1934.

I am sorry not to know much about my family. our parents did not talk too much about it.

Hope to here from you.

Zipi

Shana Tova,

I am updating the detail I have on your family in an effort to connect your branch to the tree. 
I have a few more questions:
	* When/where did Yakov pass away, and how old was he?
	* Did he have other children with Zipora? Did he have any children with Sima?
	* Did Yakov have any other siblings, besides for Zalman?
	* What is your father's name?
	* Did Yafa (your mother) have any other childen besides you?

Thank you,
