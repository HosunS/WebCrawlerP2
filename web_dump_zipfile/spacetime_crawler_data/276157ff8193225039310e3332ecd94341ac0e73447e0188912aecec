<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>Hemp History and Illegalization</H2></A>
	Historically, the term Hemp refers to any strong, fiberous plant that
has been used since pre-bibical times for a wide array of purposes.  (<A 
HREF="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/misc/nectar.of.delight">The Nectar of Delight</A> mentions that there is
evidence of hemp fiber being used in China at around 4000 B.C., as well as hemp rope in Turkestan at 3000 B.C.).   
 Cannabis, being the most commonly used of the hemp plants, produces the most durable cloth, or 'canvass'.  Canvass was used 
extensively for sails on early sea vessels, being the only material that would not rot when it came 
into contact with the salty spray.  Today, this cloth is used to produce clothing slightly softer than cotton 
but far more durable and longer lasting.  Cannabis is the only hemp plant that produces three 
additonally important products:  Pulp, seed, and medicine.  The pulp is used for fuel and paper products:  As 
 a source of cellulosic biomass, it used for the production of biomass
fuels (almost free of metals and sulfur, causing significantly less pollution than fossil fuels).  By gluing 
hemp stalks together under pressure, a tough 'composite board' (with more elasticity and strength than 
hardwood) is produced.     The 
seed is a nutritious food product for all animals of the food chain, being rich in protein and fatty oils. (The 
oil from the seeds can be used as a foundation for paints/varnishes).  Medically, Cannabis is ranked amongst the 
top medicines as a 'panaceas' or 'cure-all'; it is used to treat everything from common headaches and asthma to 
multiple sclerosis and cancer.
<p> Today, certain parts of the hemp plant are legal to possess.  According to 
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.vslib.cz/00/pub/news.answers/drugs/hemp-marijuana">Frequently Asked Questions about 
Cannabis-Hemp</A>, they are the roots, stalks, stems, and sterilized 
seeds--the components used to manufacture 
most hemp products.  The marijuana parts of the plant (which includes the flowers, buds, leaves, and living 
seeds) are illegal to possess.  Currently, hemp production in this country is treated as a felony because all 
crops are considered to contain a high level of tetrahydrocannabinols (THC--the mind-altering chemical in 
marijuana).  The fact is, industrial hemp can be grown inexpensively and, according to <A 
HREF="gopher://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/0R51-24473-/academic-info/agriculture/sustainable_agriculture/permacultur
e/Boulder-Hemp-Initiative-Project">The 
Boulder Hemp Initiative Project</A>, 
</A>, with no "pschoactive properties".  So why is the crop, to this day, illegal?  The reasons date 
back to the Spanish American War.
<p> Until the late 1800's, practically all of our clothing and paper was made from Hemp.  After the Spanish 
American War, many of the Mexican soldiers that fought against our country began to settle 
in the South-Eastern U.S., taking cheap labor jobs.  (During the War, Mexicans had received a reputation under 
the leadership of Poncho Villa to be rowdy marijuana-smokers.)  When the depression hit, jobs became scarce, and 
White America immorally  blamed Mexicans for being violent pot addicts.  As a result of this panic, marijuana 
was outlawed in several states.  When prohibition ended in the early 30's, unemployed police officers found 
work in enforcing new drug laws--by convincing American families of the dangers of marijuana.  This propoganda, 
combined with the hemp opposition from newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (fearing that hemp paper 
competiton would threaten a large cheap-paper deal of his) led our Federal legislature to pass the Marijuana Tax 
Act of 1937.  This law not only destroyed the national hemp industry, but also led to its illegality shorty after World War II.  
	<p>On an proper social level, it can't be said that hemp has made it popular.  Anti-hemp propoganda has 
been expressed in such films as "Reefer Madness" and its sequel.  During the 1970's, in fact, every mention of 
the word "hemp" was found and removed from American high school textbooks!

<p>As mentioned by Ben Masel in his <A HREF="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/hemp/hemp.flyer">Untitled Hemp 
Flyer</A>, "America cannot return to prosperity without restoring prosperity to its farmers".  In his hemp-
informative essay, Masel points out that the potential for perhaps the greatest time, space, money, and energy 
conserving crop in this country remains as a red-taped taboo and an imported commodity (mostly from 
Europe and China, where low THC strains are allowed to harvest).  Oh well!  In the meantime, while we are still legally 
allowed to wear clothes made from hemp fiber, there will always be a variety of hemp products available to the 
American consumer.<p>On line, and located in San Francisco, California, is the <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Art/grateful_dead/hemporium">Hemporium</A>, offering a variety of "hemp 
products in a boutique setting".  The specialties that this shop offers includes custom-fitted fabrics, made 
from 100% hemp:  How about a tailor-made blazer for $150.00, or a replica of The Declaration of Independence on hemp
paper for only $23.00? They also sell 100% Hemp seed oil, a favorite amongst vegetarians and health-enthusists, 
for only $23.00 per 8-ounce bottle.  Offering a general catalog of hemp products is  <A 
HREF="http://www.hempbc.com/virtual_store/catalog/catalogmain.html">HempBC's </A>Online Catalogue, 
located in Vancouver, BC.  Give them your credit card on-line, and they will sell you anything from hemp 
cosmetics, underwear, and ties to such raw textiles as paper and fabric.<P> But the proponents of cannabis 
not only include its business-people, but also important activists and politicians.  Perhaps the most famous hemp activist 
is Jack Herer, author of the pro-hemp bible, "The Emperor Wears No Clothes".  The book is a series of essays and chapters 
on hemp uses, current legislation, and proposed legalization.
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.vslib.cz/00/pub/news.answers/drugs/hemp-marijuana">Frequently Asked Questions about Cannabis 
Hemp</A> refers to Herer as "the world's most beloved hemp activist".  (I, myself had the rare pleasure of speaking 
with the man at a small hemp rally in Costa Mesa this past summer--and boy, does this guy have a lot to say!)  
Equally powerful as a hemp-enthusiast is California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who is sponsoring "medical 
marijuana bill, AB 1597", a movement that would protect doctor-recommended patients (usually terminally ill) 
against the laws of personal possession and marijuana cultivation.  More on this fascinating topic, including 
mention of The Cannabis Buyer's Club (a store in San Francisco that the police have thus far ignored for selling 
marijuana to dying people) can be located at <A 
HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shaman/files/NORML-news/NORML-news-3-2-95.html">NORML: News for 3-2-95</A>.<p>  In 
the lawmaker's court these days, marijuana seems to be an entirely new ballgame:  On February 9 of this year, the 
Baltimore Sun's front page stated that a Baltimore Grand Jury suggested the decriminalization of marijuana in an 
attempt to remove profit from the illegal drug trade, and as an "honest response" against the fact that possession 
laws are seldom enforced<A 
HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shaman/files/NORML-news/NORML-news-2-9-95.html">(NORML: News for 2-9-95)</A>.             
Note that these recent developments are advancing the status of 
marijuana instead of hemp; however, with the legalization of 
marijuana comes the legalization of growing hemp once again.
<p></A>Highly influential on the future of hemp products is the poweful, non-profit CHA 
(Coalition for Hemp Awareness).  In April 1993, the CHA, along with 
the four other largest hemp companies in America, formed the True 
Hemp Industry Alliance.  According to <A HREF="gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Environment/hemp.labels">HempWorld</A>, this 
organization will  provide for a "Seal" of authenticity that "shall
accompany all True Hemp Fabric and True Hemp Products imported,
distributed, or manufactured by those who join this cooperative
effort".  The reason behind these painstaking measures is 
that fraudulent companies have been offering hemp products to the public that 
are, in fact, hemp-less and counterfeit.

<p>When the conversation spins around to the issue of hemp, I myself have a heck of a lot to
say:  But I will try to keep my observations brief, and written with the optomism that hemp shall soon be legalized.
 <p> There is an infinite number of uses for hemp in today's 
world, many of which are yet to be utilized.  For example, we could use hemp to make cement, to pave our roads and build 
our foundations:  Currently in France, a process that mineralizes hemp stalks into a heavy-duty,
 synthetic chemical-free cement (called "Isochanvre") is being used for drywall and insulation.
Although hemp-manufactured bioplastics have not been fully developed, I believe them to be the wave of the future:
Plastic products that we currently waste our precious time and resources unnaturally developing could be
 beneficially replaced by a synthetic plastic made from natural means.  Not only will we be able to produce a entirely
biodegradable, recyclable material, but we will also boost the economy of our nation's producers.  In an untitled
 WWW document 
from <A HREF="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/hemp/not.for.environment">Mike Berger</A>, this anti-hemp activist states
that, "Unfortunately, the commercial/environmental issue is very weak".  What this person obviously does not understand, is that 
hemp could be the one crop to preserve the future of our farmers.  Last year,<A 
HREF="gopher://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/0R51-24473-/academic-info/agriculture/sustainable_agriculture/permaculture/Boulder-Hemp-Initiative-Project> 
The Boulder Hemp Initiative Project</A> published 
a consumer report that contained the following information:  The total "Estimated Value of a Hemp Crop", utilizing all parts 
of the plant for everthing except substance intake, is valued at $860.00 per acre; the "Value of Comparable Crops" is (per 
acre) $370.00 for cotton, $50 for douglas fir, and $170.00 for soybeans.  As a space efficient, pesticide-free crop, hemp 
could replace all three of these standards as a healthier and sturdier substitute.  And our farmers--couldn't they use the extra 
cash to enhance their farms with state-of-the-art resources?
<p>	Perhaps the most useful product that hemp could be attributed to is our every day paper needs.  There is no need to cut down as 
much as one more tree when we can grow fields of hemp.  While a tree can take decades to spawn to maturity, a hemp plant takes 
less than 
nine months to grow to full bloom.  Every new book, newspaper, and milk carton could be constructed from this easily grown resource.
