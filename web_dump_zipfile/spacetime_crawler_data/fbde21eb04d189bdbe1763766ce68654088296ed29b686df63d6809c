Hello.  My name is Jessica Langsam Chisholm and I am doing some research on
my family tree.  I came across your website during my search and was hoping
you could give me some additional information.  Do you have anything on the
following names?
    Max Langsam (my grandfather)
    Jacob Langsam (my great grandfather)
    Jacob's first wife
    Jacob's parents
I know that Max and Jacob lived in New York during the 1900's.  Max (my
grandfather) died in 1987.
If you have any information, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  I do not have
a email account, but you can email a friend of mine at:  techspec@ea.net 
and she will forward the information to me.
Thanks so much!
Jessica Langsam Chisholm
Baltimore, Maryland

Moishe-
Jessica Chisholm does not have an email account, nor does she have a
computer.  She is a friend of mine, and her husband teaches at the same
school as me.   Therefore, I helped her with her online research and allowed
her to use my email account for communicating with you.  I can relay any
information you get to her, and I will send her information back to you.
Thanks for your help!
Judy
