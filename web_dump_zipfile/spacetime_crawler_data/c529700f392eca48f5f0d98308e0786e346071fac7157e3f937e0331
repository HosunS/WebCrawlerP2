  <p>
    To interpret the results of a high-throughput data experiments, it
    is necessary to determine the global false positive and negative
    levels inherent in the data set being analyzed. We have implemented
    a mixture-model based method described by Allison <i>et
    al.</i> <a href="/help/#references">[13]</a> for the
    computation of the global false positive and negative levels
    inherent in a DNA microarray experiment <a href="/help/#references">[6,8]</a>.  
    The basic idea is to consider
    the <i>p-</i>values as a new data set and to build a probabilistic
    model for these new data. When control data sets are compared to one
    another (i.e. no differential gene expression) it is easy to see
    that the <i>p-</i>values ought to have a uniform distribution
    between zero and one. In contrast, when data sets from different
    genotypes or treatment conditions are compared to one another, a
    non-uniform distribution will be observed in which <i>p-</i>values
    will tend to cluster more closely to zero than one.

      <i>lrp-</i> data from Hung et al. </b>
    <a href="/help/#references">[7]</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <i>p-</i>values, based on a regularized t-test distribution, of
    the 2,758 genes (<i>lrp+</i> vs. <i>lrp-</i>) expressed at value
    above background in all replicate experiments grouped into 100 bins
    and plotted against the number of genes in each bin. The dotted line
    indicates the uniform distribution of <i>p-</i>values under
    conditions of no differential expression. The fitted model (dashed
    curve) is a mixture of a beta and the uniform distribution (dotted
    line).

    That is, there will be a subset of differentially expressed genes
    with &quot;significant&quot; <i>p-</i>values.  The computational
    method of Allison <a href="/help/#references">[13]</a>
    is used to model this mixture of uniform and non-uniform
    distributions to determine the probability, PPDE(p) ranging from 0
    to 1, that any gene at any given <i>p-</i>value is differentially
    expressed; that is, that it is a member of the uniform (not
    differentially expressed) or the non-uniform (differentially
    expressed) distribution. With this method, we can estimate the rates
    of false positives and false negatives as well as true positives and
    true negatives at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold,
    PPDE(&lt;p). In other words, we can obtain a posterior probability
    of differential expression PPDE(p) value for each gene measurement
    and a PPDE(&lt;p) value at any given <i>p-</i>value threshold based
    on the experiment-wide global false positive level and
    the <i>p-</i>value exhibited by that gene
    <a href="/help/#references">[6,8]</a>. It should also
    be emphasized that this information allows us to infer the
    genome-wide number of genes that are differentially expressed; that
    is, the fraction of genes in the non-uniform distribution
    (differentially expressed) and the fraction of genes in the uniform
    distribution (not differentially expressed).
