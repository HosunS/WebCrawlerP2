<a href="H97LeahTeich2JoelTeich8.pdf">28-Leah Teich to Joel Teich Letter to translate 8.pdf</a>
seems to show that Leibush was:
- Moses Leib
- born 1904 (22 December?)
- to Meir (sp?) and Chayki (nickame for Chaya) nee Frankel

Yes I do. This record is wrong. Pesel was Leah's sister. Both 
were my aunts. It was Leah who was married to Leibush Langsam, 
not Pesel. Leah and Leibush were both killed in ww2. Pesel 
emigrated to Palestine in the 1930s. She contracted malaria there. 
Her brother, my father, Joel brought her to toronto for treatment 
in 1938. Sadly she was killed in a traffic accident in toronto in 
1938 while crossing a street on her way to an oneg Shabbat. She is 
buried here in toronto.

Hi,

The uncle is Jakob Horowitz. Not sure how that connects. I posted 
to TTT for a translation. What happened to Mendel Langsam? Did he 
survive?

I have many letters to my dad from his sister Leah before she was killed 
by the Nazis. Going through some of these, I found this; see attached. 
Should be helpful to you. By the way, I have letters in Yiddish and german 
and polish from her that have not been translated. Do you know of anyone 
who can translate these?
 
Regards
Ira

Were you able to read Mendelï¿½s letter in german, that I shared with you?  In 
it, he talks about an uncle in New York, and other references ï¿½ that may be 
good hints for you.

Some years ago, a lady called me claiming that leib Langsam was her uncle and 
she knew the names of his 3 children and it matched my information. I will 
try to dig up her name.

Hi,
Trying to find proof that your Mendel/Leib brothers are the same as the ones I am looking at.

I only know that Leibush Langsam married my aunt Leah Teich/ Leah who was born 1903 Brzozow, 
Killed 1943. Their 3 children were Israel b 1936, Mindel b.1931, Avraham-Yitzchak b 1932

Leibish did had a brother, Mendel, who lived in Budapest for a while. He wrote to my dad in 
1940 from there and sent regards from leah and Leibish who were in Tyrana Wocosca (sp?) at 
the time. I have that letter, written in german. So it looks like we have a ï¿½hitï¿½ on those 
children. Amazing.
 
I am attaching that letter in german from mandel Langsam dated 1940 and apparently he included 
a pic of himself.

Hi Ira,
Do you have any detail on that Leibush, so I can try to determine if he was the same as "my" Leib?

Hello Moishe,
My aunt, Leah Teich was married to Leibush Langsam. Both were killed in Galicia WW2, along with 
their 3 young children. The family was from that area, Lesko, Pzemesyl, Brzozow, all within a 
few kms. Does that help?

Hi,

I am researching the family of 
Hirsch Langsam, wife Elka & sons Mandel, Leib, Yitzchok, Avraham, Yosef & Yehoshua

The children were born in the 1890's.

Hello Moshe 
I believe we have exchanged emails some years ago. I have not posted info in many years. 
My aunt, <a href="teich-leah-pot.jpg">Leah Teich</a>, married <a href="langsam-leibush-pot-ii.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="langsam-leibush-pot-ii.jpg" alt="" width="14" height="17" border="0"></a> Leibush Langsam, in Brzozow, a few years before ww2.
She and their 3 small children were murdered in 1941. Leibush tried to cross the Sanok 
river into Russia and I believe was <a href="langsam-leibush-pot.jpg">killed</a> in that attempt. 

I also have a great great great grandfather named avram aba (teich). Other family names 
in my tree include gottleib/gotfried, Shulman, fink, esterles, frum. 

My family was known (internally) by a mysterious name: family of the golden flag. But I have 
never been able to find a reference to that anywhere, and it remains a mystery. 

Best regards,

Ira

Hello,
I saw your recent LANGSAM posting to the JGFF and was hoping you could share some more detail 
about your current research interests. What are the names of the Langsam ancestors that you 
are posting about? Have you had a chance to review my website on the family at www.langsam.com ?

Please stay in touch,
