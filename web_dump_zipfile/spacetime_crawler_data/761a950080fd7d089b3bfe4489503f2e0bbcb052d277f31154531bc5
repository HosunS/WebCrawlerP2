<h1>
Metric Denoising: A Geometric Perspective
</h1>
<h2>
Yusu Wang
</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
Many geometric and topological methods rely on the metric information of input
data. In this talk, I will explore three natural setups for modeling noise
associated with input data/metric. Specifically, (i) the input data could already
be embedded in a metric space, but the embedding may be noisy; or (ii) we are
given a noisy discrete n-point metric as input which could include outliers; and
we aim to remove these outliers and embed remaining points to a target metric
space with low distortion; or (iii) the target metric is induced from an input
graph which itself is noisy, leading to noisy graph metrics. I will describe the
specific noise model in each setup and present denoising approaches for each case
to recover the metric information with theoretical guarantees. Our methods draw
ideas from computational geometry, theoretical computer science and statistical
modeling.

<b>Brief Bio</b>:   
Yusu Wang is Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering
Department at the Ohio State University. She obtained her PhD degree from Duke
University, where she received the Best PhD Dissertation Award at CS Dept., Duke
U, in 2004. Before joining OSU in 2005, she was a post-doctoral fellow at
Stanford University from 2004--2005. Yusu Wang works in the fields of
Computational geometry and Computational topology. She is primarily interested in
developing effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data / shape
analysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods, and in applying them
to practical domains, including computational biology, computer graphics and
visualization. She received DOE Early Career Principal Investigator Award in
2006, NSF Career Award in 2008, and several best paper awards, including the Best
Paper award in SIGSPATIAL GIS 2015 and the Mark Fulk Best Student Paper award in
COLT 2015.
