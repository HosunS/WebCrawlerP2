<p>Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) communities develop large-scale
software using complex distributed, collaborative processes. F/OSS is
an arena in which "public proofs" based on limited evidence, variable
social capital, and questionable expertise are routinely made:
developers unknown to one another try proving that a design strategy
is good or that a specific repair will be reliable; politicians,
managers, and advocates debate the merits of open versus closed
software strategies and acquisition policies, and so on.</p>

<p>Many of these debates (certainly those within the developer
communities) are founded on concrete artifacts (such as software
codes) and representations (such as problem reports, screenshots, and
execution traces) whose accumulation, use, and interpretation are
distributed across space and time. These distributed objects are used
as direct representations of facts, as supporting evidence, and as
discourse media in public debates. Yet because they extend across
space and time, they are fundamentally mysterious in these roles. For
example, we find serious limitations in many common assumptions about
how software codes, experience reports, and problem interpretations
work as representations for supporting problem-solving and
argumentation.  Similarly, we only have limited accounts of how they
support practices of software use. In one instance we have examined
closely, problem reports archived longitudinally in large distributed
issue-management repositories don't behave as faithful reflections of
user experiences and source code conditions, and participants can't
use them directly and unambiguously to support specific positions or
design decisions. Instead, in practice these reports appear as
massive, contentious assemblages of information constantly stressed by
ongoing reorganization and reinterpretation. In many cases, recorded
comments conflict, readers can't interpret comments, problems are
reported more than once in different ways, and it is often difficult
to correlate or link reports and with underlying
manifestations. Empirical observations like these reveal many
interesting issues of representation and practice. In this paper we
unpack several kinds of representations and practices common in F/OSS
communities, linking them to the problems of 1) creating consensus, 2)
building social capital, and 3) taking definitive actions such as
committing to specific software coding solutions or allocating
developer resources.</p>
