<H4><A NAME="anchor1">Introduction</A></H4>
<p>There is a fierce  fight going on in the Russian Caucasian territory of 
Chechnya.  The Chechens are one of the most unpopular ethnic groups in 
Russian History.  The mainly Moslem territory is under siege by Russian 
forces attempting to win back the small territory from the rebels.  Many 
different factors seem to be to blame for the uprising as well as the 
fierce attempt to squelch the insurgents.  The United Nations is not 
getting involved other than to help refugees displaced by the heavy 
fighting find a decent supply of food and shelter, and to take the burden 
off of the good natured souls who are now supporting them.  New 
developements are constantly arising in either the political forum in 
Moscow, on the battlefield in the war torn territory, or on the streets 
of Russia and the ever-changing support of the population.  Many people 
are unsure on whether they should support the fighting or oppose 
Yeltsin.  It is a tough political stance to take because the motives for 
the fighting are all questionable.  It is well known that the political
 and economic situation in Russia is very poor and is actually looked upon
 as a joke by many workers.  Yeltsin has made a
 definite stance on the issue to win 
back the territory, but the reasons why are not so clear.  Another 
thing that is unsure is the outcome and the eventual costs of the 
fighting that are sure to plague either country for many years.

Outline</A><p> <HR> <H4><A NAME="anchor2">The Role of the United 
Nations</A></H4>
 <p> The United Nations does not seem very concerned with the events that 
are transpiring in Chechnya as of now.  The concern with Bosnia and the 
Serbs is a much greater concern at this point, but it seems that with the 
apparent slaughter that seems to be the goal of Russia, there would be 
some cause for intervention or concern on the part of the United 
Nations.  However, it appears that the U.N. is attempting to help the 
displaced Chechens who fled the country during the fierce fighting and 
assault on their capital Grozny.  <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org/11/uncurr/DH">The Daily Highlights of the 
United Nations</A> available on Gopher, mention Chechnya very little, and 
it apparent that they are not attempting to curb the fighing.  they are, 
however, making a very concentrated effort to help the refugees of the 
fighting, but as one diplomat says, "There are tens of thousands of 
people who need help urgently and Moscow
recognizes this. Yet it can't get its act together and issue visas."  
The general consensus is that the U.N. has no part in the political 
matters of Russia, but the estimated 100,000 refugees are of great 
concern to them.

<H4><A NAME="anchor3">Various Views of the War</A></H4>
The atmosphere is constantly changing on the battlefield, as well as in 
the Kremlin and the streets as far as the consensus of the people.  Part 
of the general attitude of the people surfaces in <A 
HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9503/950312-2.html">
A Revival For Russian Dissident Chechen War Provides New Reason to
Protest</A>, an overview of one woman's ideas which are most likely 
shared with much of the population.  Susanna Pechuro feels that the war 
with Chechnya is a new genocide.  She was alive and protesting against 
Stalin, which got her thrown in a labor camp, when he deported the 
Chechens.  Now she says that Yeltsin is destroying them.  She is not 
alone in her analysis.  Much of the outside media cites evidence of major 
human rights breaches.  According to Voice of America, Yelena Bonner, a 
human rights activist, has resigned from Russia's  Human Rights  
Commission because President Yeltsin and those around him have 
abandoned the human rights issue. The death toll, according to VOA's 
Russian correspondent Peter Collins has reached about 25,000 
<I>civilians</I> in almost three months of fighting.  That incredible 
number leads many people to believe that it is a conscious effort to 
completely destroy the Chechen people.
<p><A HREF="file://localhost/u3/ea/eaaa074/paper/article1">Another 
view</A> is told by Professor M. Berlin in Moscow.  From talking 
to English speaking Muscovites, he has received a wide range of ideas 
concerning the Russian involvement in Chechnya.  His initial findings 
were that there is a feeling that there is not much in Chechnya worth 
the loss of Russian lives, and that the incompetence displayed is all 
the fault of Boris Yeltsin.  Berlin says " If
Yeltsin counted on the Russian bias against Chechens (and others from 
the 
Caucasus)
to win public support, he miscalculated." Chechnya is a republic and 
many people just don't see any real reason to be fighting a country 
in which the people "just do crime" according to one woman.  There is 
much bigotry expressed against the people of Chechnya.  This particular 
woman also seemed to think that "nothing is grown or manufactured in 
Chechnya, and that the local oil industry 
cost
Russia more than it produces in product." (Berlin) Actually many feel 
that Chechnya should be given total independence, and expelled from the 
Russian federation. (Berlin)</p>
<p>Yeltsin, of course, has his own reasons for the invasion of Chechnya.  
As Margaret Shapiro Reports in her <A 
HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941222-2.html">
Washington Post Article</A>, Chechnya is a Republic  "which unilaterally
declared its independence in 1991 and which Russia says has become a base for
arms dealers and gangsters."  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev justified 
the military assault on Chechnya by saying that it was prompted by the
activity of armed groups, which are totally intolerable in any country." 
(Shapiro)  The purpose, according to Yeltsin, seems to be to reestablish 
order and the local economy and not to totally destroy the Chechen people.
<p><A HREF="#anchor6">Return to Outline</A><p> 
<HR> 
<H4><A NAME="anchor4">Political Motives Behind the Fighting</A></H4>
As stated before, it is highly possible that Yeltsin was trying to feed 
off the Russian people's dislike for the Chechen people when he decided 
to invade their small Republic, but if that was the case, then it 
backfired badly.  Because of the tough economic situation in Russia as 
well as the surrounding areas, it is highly possible, as reported by Kunio 
Sakuma, a Soviet Union Researcher, that "The tough stance taken by the 
Yeltsin
administration in regard to Chechnya should keep 'regional uprisings' 
under tentative control, but it is quite possible that regional 
authorities will 
start to push gradually for an expansion of their own powers." And it is 
also very possible that Yeltsin feels the economies of Russia and the 
surrounding areas would not be able to handle a full independence of 
Russia at this point.  Every economy of the area is in bad shape and 
many people are on strike because there is no money to pay anyone.  If 
all of their resources continue to fall apart, such as the oil supply in 
Chechnya, then their economic base will be completely destroyed and they 
will inevitably slip back into the trap of communism.  
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, Chechnya has to fight for their own 
independence in order to finally beat what has plagued them for 
centuries, being under the rule of an oppressive Russia.  Chechens have a 
sort of genetic distrust of Russia due to the Stalin era as well as ages 
before of exile and deportation.  The desire to be completely independent 
of an imperialistic nation such as Russia must be absolutely overwhelming 
for them.  
 <p><A 
HREF="#anchor6">Return to

<p>My main sources of updated information are the brief but apparently 
accurate reports of Voice of America correspondents in Russia.  The <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher.voa.gov/11/pub/radio/newswire>newswire</A> has 
up-to-date information for the current week, but contains no archives.  
This week, there doesn't seem to be much action due to the take over of 
Grozny by Russian troops.  There is apparently still sniper fire and the 
soldiers are able to get in and out of the city under cover of darkness, 
but the battlefield is much quieter.  From the last reports of Peter 
Collins in Moscow on the Chechnya conflict, he reported that 
<UL>
<LI>"THE 
VILLAGE OF SAMASHKY IS A PROSPEROUS FARMING COMMUNITY  
40 KILOMETERS WEST OF GROZNY.  IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL REMAINING  
CHECHEN STRONGHOLDS SINCE RUSSIAN FORCES CAPTURED THE CAPITAL.

SAMASHKY HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE BY RUSSIAN ARTILLERY FOR WEEKS, AND
NOW RUSSIAN TANKS HAVE CUT A ROAD LINKING THE VILLAGE WITH  
REBEL-HELD TERRITORY TO THE SOUTH."  
</UL>
I have this article in my mail 
archives because it would no longer be available on-line.  The main 
complaints now are that Russian artillery is hitting the Chechen 
villages, supposedly killing numerous civilians.  This is the reason that 
many people are making a human rights issue out of the war.  Because of 
the need for Russian troops to expose the Chechens in their home 
territory, they must fire upon the villages that they are held up in, and 
if the  Chechen citizens have not yet been able to flee, then there 
are bound to be casualties.
<p>
<p> <A HREF="#anchor6">Return to

<HR> 
<H4><A NAME="anchor5">Possible Outcomes</A></H4>
<p>  One of the main statements that Yeltsin has been sure to make is 
that he vows <A 
HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941222-2.html">
not to punish the Chechens</A>.  According to Margaret Shapiro's report, 
Yeltsin also claimed that the refugees will be allowed to return to their 
homes.  Of course, this is all assuming that Russia wins.  This seems 
inevitable.  When they do win, it appears that the only way they are 
going to be able to maintain any sort of control over Chechnya is to put 
them under a sort of military rule and control all aspects of their 
government for a while.  But the desire for everyone is to avoid what has 
happened to the Chechen people over their <A 
HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941218-1.html">
long history</A>.  The fact is that the Chechen people have been punished 
for their Muslim based religion, their geographical location (being in 
the way of Russia's path to India and Syria), and their natural 
resources.  When Hitler was enacting his "final solution" upon the Jews, 
the same thing was happening to the Chechen people.  Yeltsin can not let 
that happen.  
<p> If Chechnya miraculously pulls out a victory, they will have quite a 
struggle with their economy being totally separate from Russia, as well 
as the obvious trouble that Russia will give them in any economic move 
that they may make.  They respect as an independent nation will be 
non-existent as will be an effective form of government.  Right now, it 
just seems like a no-win war.

<H4>Some Articles</H4>
<p> Much of the information that I have accumulated came from articles 
that I had to mail to myself in order to preserve them, otherwise when 
the different sights were updated, I would have lost the information.  I 
have put them all in a <A 
HREF="/u3/ea/eaaa074/paper">Chechnya Archive</A>, but I do 
not know if they will be available on my local disk to everyone.
