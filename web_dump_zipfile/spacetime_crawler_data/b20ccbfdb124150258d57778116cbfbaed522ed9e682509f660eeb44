Introduction</h2>
This is a summary of a final project for ICS 278 (Data Mining) at UC Irvine,
taught by <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth">Professor Padhraic Smyth
</a>in
Fall 1999. For more details on this project please read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dchudova/278/Report.html">full
final project report</a>.

<h2>
Background on the Data Set</h2>
The transactional data I used for the project reflect the purchases that
occurred during the two year period in the large chain retail stores. There
is a total of ~500,000 transactional records that correspond to ~190,000
different customers. The data were supplied by one of the commercial firms
and is thus considered confidential.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>
Description of the Task</h2>
I aimed at classification and discovery of local patterns in the transactional
data. The labels for classification were assigned based on how often the
customer made purchases in the store over a two year period. The input
data were constructed as a frequency of purchases made by each customer
in a department or alternatively as a relative customer's spending in the
department. The data set consisted of 8150 examples with 55 continuous
attributes. The input data were built using a subset of 50000 transactions.

<h2>
Description of the Data Mining Algorithm</h2>
I used decision tree induction algorithm <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/ml_programs/Programs.html">C5.0</a>
available as an ICS module. C5.0 decision trees create piece wise constant
decision boundaries in the original attribute space. I also used C5.0 to
produce a set of local ruled based on the decision trees.
<p>

<h2>
Experimental Methodology</h2>
I used cross validation to estimate performance of the classifier on the
unseen data. For a total&nbsp; of 8150 examples, I used 10 folds, with
each fold preserving the proportion of negative and positive examples found
in the original full data set. To estimate <a href="Report.html#ClassificationResults">the
performance of decision trees</a>, I looked at CV error, standard deviation
of CV error, false negative, and false positive rate. To estimate the quality
of local rules, I looked at the total number of rules, rule length, and
rule confidence.

<h2>
Results and Interpretation</h2>
<a href="Report.html#ClassificationResults">Classification</a>
<p>High generalization ability of classifier is supported by the following
results:
<ul>
<li>
High average CV accuracy</li>

<li>
Low variance of classification accuracy across folds</li>
</ul>
<a href="Report.html#LocalRules">Local Rules</a>
<ul>
<li>
Good generalization ability: an average of 45 rules for ~7000 patterns</li>

<li>
Relatively <a href="Report.html#RuleLength">short rules</a>: most of the
rules don't involve more than 3-4 departments</li>

<li>
<a href="Report.html#RuleConfidence">High confidence</a> of rules: half
the rules have a confidence greater than 0.95</li>
</ul>
