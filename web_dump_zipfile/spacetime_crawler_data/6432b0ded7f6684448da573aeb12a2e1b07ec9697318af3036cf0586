+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

3. The README file contains information about the files included in
the FTP server.  All data files are compressed. The files with .zip
extension are compressed with the PKZIP compression utility and they
are for participants with IBM PC compatible hardware. The PKUNZIP
utility is needed to unzip these files. The files with .Z extension
are UNIX COMPRESSed and they are for the participants with UNIX
compatible hardware. YOU WILL EITHER NEED THE DATA FILES <cup98LRN.ZIP
AND cup98VAL.ZIP> *OR* <cup98LRN.TXT.Z AND cup98VAL.TXT.Z>, BUT NOT
BOTH. REMEMBER TO FTP THESE FILES IN BINARY MODE.

4. The data sets are in comma delimited format. The learning dataset
<cup98LRN.txt> contains 95412 records and 481 fields. The first/header
row of the data set contains the field names.

The validation dataset <cup98VAL.txt> contains 96367 records and 479
variables. The first/header row of the data set contains the field
names.

THE RECORDS IN THE VALIDATION DATASET ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECORDS IN
THE LEARNING DATASET EXCEPT THAT THE VALUES FOR THE TARGET/DEPENDENT
VARIABLES ARE MISSING (i.e., the fields TARGET_B and TARGET_D are
not included in the validation data set.)

5. The data dictionary (for both the learning and the validation data
set) is included in the file <cup98DIC.txt>. The fields in the data
dictionary are ordered by the position of the fields in the learning
data set. The dictionary for the validation data set is identical to
the dictionary for the learning data set except the two target fields
(target_B and target_D) are missing in the validation data set.

6. Blanks in the string (or character) variables/fields and periods in
the numeric variables correspond to missing values.

7. Each record has a unique record identifier or index (field name:
CONTROLN.) For each record, there are two target/dependent variables
(field names: TARGET_B and TARGET_D). TARGET_B is a binary variable
indicating whether or not the record responded to the promotion of
interest ("97NK" mailing) while TARGET_D contains the donation amount
(dollar) and is only observed for those that responded to the
promotion.

8. THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED. You are required to return the
questionnaire and the validation dataset of 96367 records by email to
<iparsa@epsilon.com> by AUGUST 19, 1998.

Each record in the returned file should consist of the following two
values:

a. The unique record identifier or index (field name: CONTROLN)
b. Predicted value of the donation (dollar) amount (for the target
variable TARGET_D) for that record 

You are also required to fill out the questionnaire (file name:
<cup98QUE.txt>. The questionnaire is used to summarize in bullet
points the data analytic techniques you've applied to the dataset.

9. Please send email to <iparsa@epsilon.com> when you download the
files so we can keep you informed about anything necessary.

10. Under no circumstances should any participant contact Paralyzed
Veterans of America (PVA) for any reason.

If you have any questions, please send email to <iparsa@epsilon.com.>
